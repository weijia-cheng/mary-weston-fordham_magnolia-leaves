			<h2 epub:type="title">Introductory</h2>
			<p>I give my cordial endorsement to this little “Book of Poems,” because I believe it will do its part to awaken the Muse of Poetry which I am sure slumbers in very many of the Sons and Daughters of the Race of which the Author of this work is a representative.</p>
			<p>The Negro's right to be considered worthy of recognition in the field of poetic effort is not now gainsaid as formerly, and each succeeding effort but emphasizes his right to just consideration.</p>
			<p>The hope, I have, is, that this Volume of “Poems” may fall among the critical and intelligent, who will accord the just meed of praise or of censure, to the end that further effort may be stimulated, no matter what the verdict.</p>
			<p>The readers I trust will find as much to praise and admire as have I done.</p>

	In Memoriam.<br/>
	ALPHONSE CAMPBELL FOKDHAM.<br/>
	Aged 6 Years, 2 Months, 20 Days.<br/>
	<br/>
	          Almost whose last words were<br/>
	          "We shall meet beyond the River."<br/>
	<br/>
	     Yes, my darling, when life's shadows<br/>
	          Over me do darkly fall,<br/>
	     Meet me surely at the river<br/>
	          As I haste to obey the call.<br/>
	     Gladly through the darksome valley,<br/>
	          Through its portals, grim and cold,<br/>
	     Will I hasten 'till my nestling<br/>
	          Meets me at the "Gates of Gold."<br/>
	<br/>
	     Sadly do I miss my wee one,<br/>
	          None can till thy vacant place,<br/>
	     Only in my dreams I fold thee,<br/>
	          Only then behold thy face.<br/>
	     See thee in thy childish beauty,<br/>
	          Clasp thy little hand in mine,<br/>
	     Ever will those moments chain me,<br/>
	          Ever in my heart enshrined.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Little Heartsease, “bud of promise”<br/>
	          Broken off in early morn,<br/>
	     Now can sin no more pollute thee<br/>
	          In the angels' bosom borne.<br/>
	<br/>
	     In that land no pain or anguish<br/>
	          Ever can my child enfold,<br/>
	     Then my darling meet thy mother<br/>
	          Surely at the "Gates of Gold.”<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MR. EDWARD FORDHAM.<br/>
	<br/>
	     When the Autumn's breezes<br/>
	          Were sweeping o'er the land,<br/>
	     Came the mighty mandate<br/>
	          From the upper land.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Now from pain and anguish<br/>
	          Thou hast found relief,<br/>
	     Passed through death's dark portal,<br/>
	          Left this world of grief.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Now thou’rt safely anchored<br/>
	          In the port aboye,<br/>
	     Gladly do we offer thee<br/>
	          Symbols of our loye.<br/>
	<br/>
	     When the welcome summons<br/>
	          Shall echo through the skies,<br/>
	     Then our ransomed brother<br/>
	           Will hear the word “Arise.”<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Death of a Grandparent.<br/>
	MRS. JENNETTE BONNEU.<br/>
	<br/>
	Rest thee aged pilgrim, now thy toils are o'er;<br/>
	Peacefully thou'st landed over Jordan's shore;<br/>
	Safe from all the sorrows, free from all the strife,<br/>
	Thon hast passed death's portals, entered into life.<br/>
	<br/>
	Doubtless thou wert weary, tempest tossed so long;<br/>
	Doubtless thou wert longing to join the happy throng;<br/>
	Doubtless many loved ones on the other shore,<br/>
	Whispered to thee softly “Stay on earth no more.”<br/>
	<br/>
	Whispered thee, come higher, where perennial bloom<br/>
	Shall with heightened luster its wonted sway resume.<br/>
	“Come where peaceful rivers quietly do flow—<br/>
	Hasten mother, hasten, from that world of woe."<br/>
	<br/>
	Then to fields Elysian she joyfully did soar,<br/>
	In the blest land of Canaan to dwell forever more;<br/>
	All through the “Golden City” she happily doth roam,<br/>
	Oft wondering why she stay'd so long away from home.<br/>
	<br/>
	So 'neath the bending willows we've laid thee down to rest,<br/>
	Well knowing thou'rt reposing secure on Jesus' breast;<br/>
	Well knowing that one day will come, the welcome word Arise,<br/>
	Come up, thou ransomed mortal, to thy Saviour in the skies.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	QUEENIE.<br/>
	<br/>
	For one brief day, did Queenie stay<br/>
	     To brighten each, fond heart,<br/>
	Then sped like dove to realms above,<br/>
	     Ne'er more to feel death's dart.<br/>
	<br/>
	O! in that land, where infants stand<br/>
	     Arrayed in spotless sheen,<br/>
	No griefs to share, nor sorrows bear,<br/>
	     No death to intervene.<br/>
	<br/>
	We would not care, nay, would not dare<br/>
	     To wish thee back again,<br/>
	Nay, rather say, ''Queenie, good day,<br/>
	     Till we your rest attain."<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	TO AN INFANT.<br/>
	<br/>
	Just as the twilight's holy hour<br/>
	     In quietude so deep,<br/>
	Was hushing nature to repose,<br/>
	     Our "Charlie" fell asleep.<br/>
	<br/>
	Just in the bloom of infancy,<br/>
	     We laid him to his rest,<br/>
	Well knowing that our angel boy<br/>
	     Was numbered with the blest.<br/>
	<br/>
	Well knowing that the Saviour said<br/>
	     Oh! suffer such to come,<br/>
	“Forbid them not," for they are Mine,<br/>
	     And heaven is their home.<br/>
	<br/>
	So bow we to God's gracious will,<br/>
	     For he was lent, not given;<br/>
	And let this cheer our drooping hearts,<br/>
	     Our Charlie is in heaven.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	In Memoriam.<br/>
	SUSAN EUGENIA BENNETT.<br/>
	<br/>
	When the Sabbath was declining, just at twilight's mystic hour,<br/>
	Left the u Upper Courts" an angel, sent to cull our sweetest flower,<br/>
	Not in judgment, not in anger, did this white-winged seraph come,<br/>
	But to lead a little Pilgrim through Death's Portal to her home.<br/>
	<br/>
	And our angel child was ready, aye, and anxious to depart—<br/>
	Not the slightest doubt o'ershadowed her trusting little heart;<br/>
	But with a brow as radiant as rainbow in the sky,<br/>
	She whispered softly "Mother, I'm not afraid to die."<br/>
	<br/>
	When shall these little, weary limbs lie down to sweet repose,<br/>
	'Mid the green, the verdant pastures where the limpid water flows;<br/>
	When shall I the Golden City sparkling in its beauty see,<br/>
	"When shall it be, my Saviour, O! when shall I be free?”<br/>
	<br/>
	Ere the week-day with its labors, its duties and its care—<br/>
	Was ushered in, our darling was found on earth no where;<br/>
	But with the saints in glory, and the Saviour she adored,<br/>
	She's happy and at rest, for aye and ever with the Lord.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MRS. REBECCA WESTOX.<br/>
	<br/>
	"For so He giveth His beloved sleep."<br/>
	<br/>
	     She is not dead, but sleepeth;—<br/>
	          Ere long will the morning break,<br/>
	     When those we love who sleep in Him,<br/>
	          Shall from the dust awake.<br/>
	<br/>
	     She is not dead, but sleepeth;—<br/>
	          Soon, soon will the ransomed sing<br/>
	     O! grave, where is thy victory?<br/>
	          O! death, where is thy sting?<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MRS. E. COHRS BROWN.<br/>
	<br/>
	Tread not the earth where lies her youthful form,<br/>
	Grow violets, sweet violets, above that cherished mound;<br/>
	Bid zephyrs softly whisper in accents sweet and low,<br/>
	Not dead, not lost, but only gone a little while before.<br/>
	<br/>
	So, I, though bowed in anguish, yield her spirit to its God,<br/>
	And meekly clasp the smiting hand, and kiss the chast'ning rod;<br/>
	May I, when time is over, greet thee on the other shore,<br/>
	To live and love for aye and aye, where partings are no more.<br/>
	<br/>

	MRS. MARY FURMAN WESTON BYRD.<br/>
	Obituary.<br/>
	<br/>
	     BYRD. — "As one who wraps the drapery of his<br/>
	couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams, ' ' thus<br/>
	sweetly passed from earth to glory, on the morning of<br/>
	the 19th of February, 1884, Mrs. Mary Furman<br/>
	Weston Byrd, in the 92d year of hex age, leaving two<br/>
	children, twelve grand-children, and twenty great-<br/>
	grandchildren, to mourn her irreparable loss.<br/>
	     "Rising up they call her blessed." Another<br/>
	ancient landmark has been gathered to her<br/>
	Fathers. With her death a link is severed which<br/>
	bound two centuries together. The venerable subject<br/>
	of this notice was born in 1792, of parents who were<br/>
	both e riles from their native land; one being born in<br/>
	Morocco, Barbary States, the other in Marseilles,<br/>
	France. During her eventful life she passed throng<br/>
	three wars; that of 1812 in her girlhood, after the<br/>
	Mexican and the late Civil Wars. Possessed of a<br/>
	loving heart and cheerful disposition, charity was the<br/>
	guiding star of her life. Her widow's mite was never<br/>
	faund wanting. In her the distressed and the needy<br/>
	met always a ready response. She died as she lived,<br/>
	beloved and venerated by legions to whom her very<br/>
	name was a household word. So then,<br/>
	 <br/>
	     Though no blossoms cluster<br/>
	          Above thy aged brow,<br/>
	     Though winter winds are breathing<br/>
	          A requiem soft and low,<br/>
	     We look beyond earth's shadows,<br/>
	          Beyond death's misty plain.<br/>
	     And though we sadly miss thee,<br/>
	          Will not wish thee back again.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Could we but see thee, dear one,<br/>
	          In the Palace of thy Lord,<br/>
	     With thy robe of snowy whiteness,<br/>
	          And with more than youth renewed.<br/>
	     No more on bended willows<br/>
	          Would our broken harps remain,<br/>
	     Take us beauty for our ashes,<br/>
	          Take us gladness for our pain.<br/>

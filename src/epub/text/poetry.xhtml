v#O Earth, adore creative power,
v#That made and gave to man as dower,
v##This world of beauty rare,
v#With hills and vales of verdant green,
v#With rills and brooks of crystal sheen,
v##Lovely beyond compare.
</p>
<p>
v#O Sun, bright ruler of the day,
v#When first thy power thou did'st display,
v##Earth must have shrank in fear,
v#When like a meteor burst thy light,
v#Turning to day the long, long night,
v##With radiance wondrous fair.
</p>
<p>
v#Thou Moon, pale sister of the Sun,
v#When he his daily work has done,
v##Thou comest forth a queen;
v#A queen in silvery robe adorned,
v#With tiara of jewels formed,
v##Of starry orbs unseen.
</p>
<p>
v#Ye twinkling stars of milder light,
v#Though now ye gleam like sapphires bright,
v##Across yon azure dome,
v#The day will dawn, that last dread day,
v#When from yon heaven you'll fall away,
v##And man to Judgment come.
</p>
<p>
v#Thunder and Lightnings burst and gleam,
v#Frightful and fierce to us they seem
v##Rending the darkened sky.
v#Like giants tread the thunder's peal,
v#The vivid lightnings swiftly steal,
v##And men in terror fly.
</p>
<p>
v#O filmy clouds, of purest white,
v#With robes of gossamer cased in white,
v##Ye floating waters pure,
v#Sometimes to burst in cooling showers,
v#Sometimes to deluge wintry hours
v##With your relentless pour.
</p>
<p>
v#Thou beauteous Rainbow bursting forth,
v#With varied hues encircling earth;
v##The sign to Noah made.
v#“I place amid the Clouds my Bow”
v#To show that I will nevermore
v##Deluge with angry flood.
</p>
<p>
v#Mountains and Hills whose snow capped tops
v#The vast horizon overlooks,
v##Pyramids strung and sure;
v#Nor lightnings fierce nor earthquake shock
v#Can ever sway, for firm as rock
v##Ye ever will endure.
</p>
<p>
v#Thou Ocean vast, oftimes thy breast,
v#Is calm and still as if at rest,
v##Like one in quiet sleep;
v#But soon in anger thou may'st roar,
v#And madly toss from shore to shore,
v##And human harvest reap.
</p>
<p>
v#Fountains and Rivulets so clear,
v#That gush amid the valleys fair,
v##With soft and mellow ring;
v#As coming forth from glade and wood
v#Your babblings whisper “God is good,”
v##Ye make the vales to sing.
</p>
<p>
v#Now when all nature swells the song,
v#When beast and birds the strain prolong,
v##Shall man from praise refrain?
v#Then would the rocks and hills proclaim,
v#All nature crying out for shame,
v#They who their Maker's image wear,
v#Should shout and sing till rent the air
v##With rhapsodies sublime.

	SHIPWRECK.<br/>
	<br/>
	Night and a starless sky,<br/>
	Ship on wild billows tost,<br/>
	With tattered sails and opening seams.<br/>
	And deck bestrewn with falling beams.<br/>
	       Swift plunging to her doom.<br/>
	<br/>
	Red lightnings round her flash,<br/>
	Loud thunders crash and roar,<br/>
	And the noble vessel mounts the crest<br/>
	Of the reeking waves, then sinks to rest<br/>
	      Mid carnival of woe.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Petrel soars aloft,<br/>
	Trailing her hymn of death,<br/>
	And the dirge like sounds pierce the blackened sky,<br/>
	While the crew send forth one anguished cry,<br/>
	       Sinking to lowest depth.<br/>
	<br/>
	Some ships go out to sea<br/>
	That never more return,<br/>
	Souls that from heaven in infancy come,<br/>
	Tarnished and ruined by sin may become,<br/>
	Like the Dove to the Ark they never return,<br/>
	       But sink as ship to doom.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE WASHERWOMAN.<br/>
	<br/>
	With hands all reddened and sore,<br/>
	       With back and shoulders low bent,<br/>
	She stands all day, and part of the night<br/>
	        Till her strength is well-nigh spent.<br/>
	With her rub — rub — rub,<br/>
	        And her wash, rinse, shake,<br/>
	Till the muscles start and the spirit sinks,<br/>
	        And the bones begin to ache.<br/>
	<br/>
	At morn when the sunbeams scatter<br/>
	        In rays so golden and bright,<br/>
	She yearns for the hour of even,<br/>
	        She longs for the restful night.<br/>
	Still she rubs — rubs — rubs,<br/>
	        With the energy born of want,<br/>
	For the larder's empty and must be filled,—<br/>
	        The fuel's growing scant.<br/>
	<br/>
	As long as the heart is blithesome.<br/>
	        Will her spirit bear her up,<br/>
	And kindness and love imparteth a zest<br/>
	         To sweeten hard life's bitter cup.<br/>
	But to toil—toil—toil,<br/>
	         From the grey of the morn till eve,<br/>
	Is an ordeal so drear for a human t o bear,<br/>
	         Which the rich can hardly conceive.<br/>
	<br/>
	What part in the world of pleasure?<br/>
	        What holidays are her own?<br/>
	For the rich reck not of privations and tears,<br/>
	         Saying, "she is to the manoi born.”<br/>
	So dry those scalding tears<br/>
	        That furrow so deeply thy cheek,<br/>
	For rest — rest — rest<br/>
	         Will come at the end of the week.<br/>
	<br/>
	Yes, even on earth there's a day<br/>
	         When labor and toil must cease,<br/>
	The world at its birth received the mandate<br/>
	         Of the seventh day of rest.<br/>
	When the sweet-toned Sabbath bells<br/>
	         Break o'er the balmy air,<br/>
	Then sing—sing—sing<br/>
	         That the morning stars may hear.<br/>
	<br/>
	For the frugal table spread,<br/>
	         For the crust and the humble bed,<br/>
	When He to whom all earth belongs<br/>
	         Had not where to lay His head,<br/>
	Then toil for thy daily bread,<br/>
	         Let thy heart like thy hands be clean,<br/>
	And rub—rub—rub<br/>
	         Till thy hones all ache, I ween.<br/>
	<br/>
	With hands all reddened and sore,<br/>
	         With back and shoulders bent low,<br/>
	Thou hast for thy comfort that rest, sweet rest,<br/>
	         Will be found on the other shore.<br/>
	Then they who've washed their souls<br/>
	         Will dip in the crystal tide<br/>
	Of the fountain clear that was oped to man<br/>
	         From the Saviour's wounded side.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE SNOWDROP.<br/>
	<br/>
	How comest thou, O flower so fair,<br/>
	To bud and bloom while wintry air<br/>
	         Still hovers o'er the land?<br/>
	<br/>
	How comest from the cold, dark earth?<br/>
	That fostered thee and gave thee birth,<br/>
	         Studding thy brow with snow.<br/>
	<br/>
	Say, didst thou yearn for sunny bowers?<br/>
	To gladden with thy pure, pale flowers,<br/>
	         The valley and the hill?<br/>
	<br/>
	Down in the darkness whence thou came,<br/>
	Hear' st aught of passion, fashion, fame,<br/>
	         Or even greed for gold ?<br/>
	<br/>
	And when the old earth's bosom heaves,<br/>
	And scatters man like autumn's leaves.<br/>
	          With its low thundered voice,<br/>
	<br/>
	Thou sleep' st serene with eyelids closed,<br/>
	No earthquake shock breaks thy repose,<br/>
	         Till comes the breath of Spring.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE SAXON LEGEND OF LANGUAGE.<br/>
	<br/>
	The earth was young, the world was fair,<br/>
	And balmy breezes filled the air,<br/>
	Nature reposed in solitude,<br/>
	When God pronounced it "very good."<br/>
	<br/>
	The snow-capped mountain reared its head,<br/>
	The deep, dark forests widely spread,<br/>
	O'er pebbly shores the stream did play<br/>
	On glad creation's natal day.<br/>
	<br/>
	But silence reigned, nor beast nor bird<br/>
	Had from its mate a whisper heard,<br/>
	E'en man, God's image from above,<br/>
	Could not, to Eve, tell of his love.<br/>
	<br/>
	Where the four rivers met there strayed<br/>
	The man and wife, no whit afraid,<br/>
	For the arch-fiend expelled from heaven<br/>
	Had not yet found his way to Eden.<br/>
	<br/>
	But lo! a light from 'mid the tree,<br/>
	But hark! a rustling 'mongst the leaves,<br/>
	Then a fair Angel from above,<br/>
	Descending, sang his song of love.<br/>
	<br/>
	Forth sprang the fierce beasts from their lair,<br/>
	Bright feathered songsters fill the air,<br/>
	All nature stirred to centre rang<br/>
	When the celestial song began.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Lion, monarch of the plain,<br/>
	First tried to imitate the strain,<br/>
	And shaking high his mane he roared,<br/>
	Till beast and bird around him cohered.<br/>
	<br/>
	The little Linnet tuned her lay,<br/>
	The Lark, in turn, did welcome day,<br/>
	And cooing soft, the timid Dove<br/>
	Did to his mate tell of his love.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then Eve, the synonym of grace,<br/>
	Drew nearer to the solemn place,<br/>
	And heard the words to music set<br/>
	In tones so sweet, she ne'er forgot.<br/>
	<br/>
	The anthems from the earth so rare,<br/>
	Higher and higher filled the air,<br/>
	Till Seraphs caught the inspiring strain,<br/>
	And morning stars together sang.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then laggard Adam sauntered near,<br/>
	What Eve had heard he too must hear,<br/>
	But ah! for aye will woman's voice<br/>
	Make man to sigh or him rejoice.<br/>
	<br/>
	Only the fishes in the deep<br/>
	Did not arouse them from their sleep,<br/>
	So they alas! did never hear<br/>
	Of the Angel's visit to this sphere.<br/>
	For have they ever said one word<br/>
	To mate or man, or beast or bird.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE CHRIST CHILD.<br/>
	<br/>
	On a starry, wintry night,<br/>
	       Frosty and cold was the air,<br/>
	And the lowly yale where Bethlehem stood,<br/>
	       Looked bleak, and barren and bare.<br/>
	<br/>
	Her streets deserted and dim,<br/>
	       Lit only by myriads of stars,<br/>
	That with shimm'ring light illumined the night,—<br/>
	       Among them was fiery Mars.<br/>
	<br/>
	Adown 'mid the yalley so drear<br/>
	      Knelt men, in wonder and fear,<br/>
	For lo ! in the distance a bright star had risen<br/>
	       Wondrously brilliant and clear.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then an Angel's yoice they heard<br/>
	       In heayenly tones it said,<br/>
	To yon I bring “glad tidings of joy,"<br/>
	       “Fear not nor be dismayed."<br/>
	<br/>
	Go follow that star, 'twill lead<br/>
	      To the Christ-child's lowly bed,<br/>
	Though Israel's King, He sleeps in an "inn"<br/>
	      Where the cattle oft are fed.<br/>
	 <br/>
	Then oyer the humble place<br/>
	       Where the Royal Babe was laid,<br/>
	Did the “Star of the East,” blest Bethlehem’s star,<br/>
	       Irradiate no more to fade.<br/>
	<br/>
	O! brightest and best they cried,<br/>
	       Our long promised Israel's King,<br/>
	Shine out from afar, thou bright morning star,<br/>
	       To thee our offerings we bring.<br/>
	<br/>
	Bethlehem! blest city of old<br/>
	       Like pilgrims to Mecca we come,<br/>
	To thy hallowed site, on each Christmas night,<br/>
	        The Christ-child's humble home.<br/>
	 <br/>
	<br/>
	BELLS OF ST. MICHAEL.<br/>
	<br/>
	Come and listen to the chiming<br/>
	        Of St. Michael's merry bells,<br/>
	When the joyous Christmas morning,<br/>
	        All of Bethlehem's story tells.<br/>
	When they sweetly chime the anthem<br/>
	        "Glory to be to God on high,"<br/>
	When the children swell the chorus,<br/>
	        Earth to heaven seems very nigh.<br/>
	 <br/>
	On the gladsome Easter morning,<br/>
	       When the earliest flow'rets bloom,<br/>
	Snowdrops pure and violets purple<br/>
	       Blend to scatter sweet perfume;<br/>
	Then your happiest notes are poured forth,<br/>
	       Then your Jubilee is heard,<br/>
	Pealing out in joyful accents,<br/>
	       Chiming, "God is very good."<br/>
	<br/>
	From that ancient lofty turret,<br/>
	        Overlooking land and sea,<br/>
	Peals of comfort have been wafted,<br/>
	        Sounds of gladness o'er the lea.<br/>
	Many a storm-tost, weary wanderer<br/>
	        Looked to thee as hope's bright star,<br/>
	Listened to thy mellow chiming,<br/>
	        Smiling as he crossed the bar.<br/>
	<br/>
	Ah! old bells, beneath your tolling,<br/>
	       Many a form lies buried low,<br/>
	‘Neath the green-sward of “God's Acre,”<br/>
	       Rest they, all their sorrows o'er.<br/>
	Softly wave the bending willows,<br/>
	       Sweetly sing the birds their lays,<br/>
	Whilst thy dear old bells are clanging,<br/>
	       They are singing hymns of praise.<br/>
	<br/>
	Dear old bells your music thrills me,<br/>
	     Whether rung in joy or woe,<br/>
	They recall the joyous spring time<br/>
	      Of fond memory's “long ago”<br/>
	Sweetly chime through all the ages;<br/>
	      As time's cycles swiftly move;<br/>
	Peal forth loudly, Grod is gracious;<br/>
	      Whisper softly, He is love.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE EXILE'S REVERIE.<br/>
	<br/>
	'Twas sunset's hour, the glorious day<br/>
	Had in its beauty passed away:<br/>
	      The sun had bathed in golden dyes<br/>
	      This Southern land of sunny skies;<br/>
	And crimson clouds, like birds of wing,<br/>
	Did o'er the earth their radiance fling;<br/>
	       While zephyrs sang amid the trees,<br/>
	        And song-birds warbled to the breeze;<br/>
	For Spring, just bursting into birth,<br/>
	Had come once more to gladden earth.<br/>
	<br/>
	Near Pensacola's margin, lay,<br/>
	Laved by its never ceasing spray,<br/>
	      The exile, from his native land<br/>
	      The dweller on a foreign strand.<br/>
	And as he lay kind thoughts of home<br/>
	Like visions of the past did come;<br/>
	      And mem'ry's mirror pictured clear<br/>
	      The starlight of his boyhood there;<br/>
	The hopes that clustered round his brow,<br/>
	The shrine at which he loved to bow.<br/>
	<br/>
	He mused aloud, Oh! Italy!<br/>
	Land of the chivalric, the free!<br/>
	      Bruce may of Scotland tune his lyre.<br/>
	      But thee alone, can'st me inspire.<br/>
	Birthplace of beauty! never more<br/>
	Shall I behold thy vine-clad shore;<br/>
	       The sward where I in childhood play'd—<br/>
	       The haunts deep in the forest shade—<br/>
	The place where, mould' ring in decay,<br/>
	The ashes of a sire lay.<br/>
	<br/>
	Why did I leave thee?    As spring flowers<br/>
	Return no more through summer hours<br/>
	        When once they blossom, bear and die,<br/>
	        No more will bloom neath sultry sky;<br/>
	So heart of man when hopes have fled,<br/>
	And love lies buried with the dead,<br/>
	        No second spring time sends one ray<br/>
	        To cheer his path through life's dark day;<br/>
	Hope's blossoms like the early dew<br/>
	Once passed away, naught can renew.<br/>
	<br/>
	Still I live on, and oft, at eve<br/>
	My isolated cot I leave;<br/>
	        Thence to this lonely nook I hie<br/>
	        To take a glance at days gone by.<br/>
	Each blue wave hastening to its goal<br/>
	(Fit type of the immortal soul)<br/>
	        In thrilling accents seems to say<br/>
	        Thou'rt nearing fast life's closing day;<br/>
	Thou soon wilt reach thy better home,<br/>
	The home where changes never come.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE SNOW STORM.<br/>
	<br/>
	Gentle as a maiden's dream,<br/>
	Softly as the gliding stream,<br/>
	      Falls the glittering, sparkling snow.<br/>
	With its wealth of crystal pearls—<br/>
	Shining, pure-white coronals,<br/>
	With its robe of silvery sheen,<br/>
	Decking earth like virgin queen.<br/>
	<br/>
	As the noiseless flakes descend,<br/>
	As they downward quickly tend,<br/>
	      Floating waves of downy snow.<br/>
	Garnered from the upper realms;<br/>
	Harvested by unknown hands,<br/>
	Gulfed from cloudland's brightest bower,<br/>
	Sent to earth as richest dower.<br/>
	<br/>
	Symbol pure, and emblem sweet!<br/>
	Type of purity! 'twere meet<br/>
	      That many swell the strain attuned.<br/>
	Clad with garb like angels wear—<br/>
	Robed in heaven's holiest gear—<br/>
	Pure, white snow, I welcome thee,<br/>
	Hymning lays of minstrelsy.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MAIDEN AND RIVER.<br/>
	<br/>
	Maiden—River, why in ceaseless flow<br/>
	                 Must yon ripple to and fro?<br/>
	                       Stop a while.<br/>
	                 Lonely on thy bank I stand,<br/>
	                 On your shining, pebbly strand,<br/>
	                 Canst thou not a moment stay<br/>
	                 Through the long, long summer day?<br/>
	                       Stop a while.<br/>
	<br/>
	River—Child of earth dost thou not know<br/>
	                Ne'er can cease my endless flow?<br/>
	                      I must go.<br/>
	                Onward till I reach my outlet,<br/>
	                Out beyond the golden sunset,<br/>
	                Seek not then to stay my flowing,<br/>
	                Onward still I must be going<br/>
	                      To my goal.<br/>
	<br/>
	Maiden—River, when the storms are raging,<br/>
	                 Wind and rain a warfare waging,<br/>
	                        Do you fear?<br/>
	                 When thy waves with whitened crest,<br/>
	                  Toss around in wild unrest,<br/>
	                  Doth thy bosom shake with fear,<br/>
	                  Trembling, lest thy end is near?<br/>
	                        Say, O! say.<br/>
	<br/>
	River—Child, my race will ne'er be run<br/>
	                  Not till yonder blazing sun<br/>
	                        Fades away.<br/>
	                  Look t'wards the horizon's crest,<br/>
	                  See the mighty Ocean's breast,<br/>
	                  Now its billowy waves are still,<br/>
	                  He who says it is My will,<br/>
	                        Keepeth me.<br/>
	<br/>
	Maiden—River, should'st thou chance to see,<br/>
	                  On thy journey through the lea,<br/>
	                        Snow white sail?<br/>
	                  Reaching out towards the clouds,<br/>
	                  Quivering with its massive shrouds,<br/>
	                  Touch it gently with thy arms,<br/>
	                  Shield it safe from rude alarms,<br/>
	                       It is mine.<br/>
	<br/>
	River—Child of earth hast thou not heard?<br/>
	                  That He knows of beast and bird<br/>
	                        Every hair,<br/>
	                  Can He not then bring to thee<br/>
	                  Safe from o'er the murmuring sea.<br/>
	                  Mortal child O! ne'er despair,<br/>
	                  “Ship ahoy!” may greet thy ear,<br/>
	                        Soon, ay soon.<br/>
	<br/>
	Maiden — River, then glide sweetly on,<br/>
	                  Till thy goal is safely won,<br/>
	                         Till at last<br/>
	                  Thou dost hear like thunder roar,<br/>
	                  Breaking from the golden shore,<br/>
	                  Awful words from saered lore,<br/>
	                  Time for thee shall be no more.<br/>
	                        River, farewell.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	CHICAGO EXPOSITION ODE.<br/>
	<br/>
	Columbia, all hail!<br/>
	      May thy banner ne'er be furled<br/>
	Till Liberty, with her beauteous rays,<br/>
	      Enlighten all the world.<br/>
	Columbia, to thee<br/>
	      From every clime we come,<br/>
	To lay our trophies at thy feet—<br/>
	      Our sunbright, glorious home.<br/>
	                       * * *<br/>
	'Twas a lovely autumn morn,<br/>
	      And the leaves were turning red,<br/>
	And the sturdy oaks and graceful pines<br/>
	      Their branches over-spread;<br/>
	And the breezes softly swept<br/>
	      The hills and valleys o'er;<br/>
	And the dew-kissed earth with incense sweet,<br/>
	      Crowned forest, grove and flower.<br/>
	<br/>
	On a grassy knoll near by<br/>
	      Where the rustling leaves were piled,<br/>
	Knelt a mighty chief of a mighty tribe,<br/>
	      And his band of warriors wild.<br/>
	For the rising sun had shown<br/>
	      To the trained eyes of that band,<br/>
	That vessels three, like white- winged birds,<br/>
	      Were steering straight for land.<br/>
	<br/>
	Whence comes this stranger fleet?<br/>
	      Whence hails this Pale Face crew?<br/>
	And the chieftain's brow was wrapped in pain<br/>
	      As his tomahawk he drew.<br/>
	Then, with quivering voice, he said<br/>
	      Some evil may betide;<br/>
	From the land of the sky this host has come—<br/>
	      Let's haste to the river side.<br/>
	<br/>
	And the warriors started forth<br/>
	      Like fawns through the forest trees;<br/>
	When lo! what a wondrous, solemn sight—<br/>
	      “Pale Faces" on their knees!<br/>
	Before the Holy Cross,<br/>
	      Each with uncovered brow,<br/>
	Prayed the mighty God, that His blessings e'er<br/>
	      Might this fair land endow.<br/>
	<br/>
	And the stalwart braves—awe-struck—,<br/>
	      With heads bowed low on breast<br/>
	As the veteran sailor proudly cried<br/>
	      San Salvador, the blest!<br/>
	And this first, grand solemn act<br/>
	      Has been chronicled in heaven;<br/>
	For, from East to West of this broad, fair land,<br/>
	      Has God's benison been given.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then hail! bright, sunny land!<br/>
	      Home of the free, the brave!<br/>
	From the eastern shores to the western plains,<br/>
	      Let thy banner proudly wave.<br/>
	Nations beyond the seas<br/>
	      Shall worship at thy shrine;<br/>
	Honor and wealth, and matchless power,<br/>
	      Columbia! be thine.<br/>

	''Cast down your bucket where you are,"<br/>
	From burning sands or Polar star<br/>
	From where the iceberg rears its head<br/>
	Or where the kingly palms outspread;<br/>
	'Mid blackened fields or golden sheaves,<br/>
	Or foliage green, or autumn leaves,<br/>
	Come sounds of warning from afar,<br/>
	“Cast down your bucket where you are."<br/>
	<br/>
	What doth it matter if thy years<br/>
	Have slowly dragged 'mid sighs and tears?<br/>
	What doth it matter, since thy day<br/>
	Is.brightened now by hope's bright ray.<br/>
	The morning star will surely rise,<br/>
	And Ethiop's sons with longing eves<br/>

	Rise Afric's sons and chant with joy.<br/>
	Good will to all without alloy;<br/>

	Our brothers who the gray did love<br/>
	And martyrs to their cause did prove.<br/>
	Say, once for all and once again,<br/>

	<br/>
	When first thy bright pennant was lifted on high,<br/>

	The ovation that greeted thee, rose through the air<br/>
	Like incense from altars of hearts true and dear.<br/>
	<br/>

	Thy power is acknowledged, far over the seas.<br/>
	Thy influence so boundless, that none may deny,<br/>

	THE CRUCIFICTION<br/>
	<br/>
	"Why did the sun his beams conceal<br/>
	As if unwilling to reveal<br/>
	That deed of mankind on the day<br/>
	When Jesus, at the altar, lay<br/>
	      A willing sacrifice.<br/>
	<br/>
	Earth, too, in terror shook, when He<br/>
	The Mighty, died on Calvary;<br/>
	When for our sins He bowed His head,<br/>
	Gave up the ghost, and quickly sped<br/>
	      To regions of the dead.<br/>
	<br/>
	And some who had for ages long<br/>
	Been wrapped in slumber deep and strong,<br/>
	Awoke, and by their converse showed<br/>
	That death no more dominion had<br/>
	      In that He died.<br/>
	<br/>
	Why did He die?    Ah! blissful thought,<br/>
	When we near death and hell were brought,<br/>
	He left His Father's courts above—<br/>
	O, list to such amazing love—<br/>
	      And died to save.<br/>
	<br/>
	Why did He die?    'Twas love divine<br/>
	That caused Him all things to resign—<br/>
	A heavenly choir, celestial home,<br/>
	Exalted seat, seraphic song,<br/>
	      And all to save.<br/>
	<br/>
	Blest thought! He reigns victorious now,<br/>
	To whom all earth will shortly how,<br/>
	Let men below and saints above<br/>
	Wonder at such stupendous love,<br/>
	      As caused their God to die.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	URANNE.<br/>
	<br/>
	In a far off hamlet near the sea<br/>
	Where billows oft, in days of storm, and<br/>
	Nights of darkness rush reckless to the shore;<br/>
	Where tall, white cliffs like watchmen keep<br/>
	A life-long vigil; Oft when the morning<br/>
	Sunbeams gild their lofty peaks they seem<br/>
	Like massive crystal vases adorned with<br/>
	Bays of gold.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  Hard-by those snowy cliffs,<br/>
	Shielded safe from cutting winds and icy<br/>
	Blasts, stood an humble, unpretending cot,<br/>
	Its low, thatched roof of matted moss<br/>
	Glimmered, when the morning sun brightened<br/>
	Up the valley, and cast its rays aslant tli rough<br/>
	The tiny windows ignorant of glass.    Its well-<br/>
	Scrubbed floor shone like polished wood;<br/>
	And all around an air of quiet, peace and<br/>
	Love, prevailed.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  Within that cosy nest, there<br/>
	Dwelt three loving hearts, Nay, four, for on the<br/>
	Very morn when Christmas bells were<br/>
	Hinging o'er the land, When children of the rich<br/>
	And children of the poor alike, were talking<br/>
	Of the Christ-child, and his day, Unto them a<br/>
	Child was given, And this lovely babe, blest Christmas<br/>
	Gift, — was richly prized. E'en now she knew her<br/>
	Father's voice, and leaped with joy at his return.<br/>
	                                      * * *<br/>
	But ah! the cry of war, broke o'er the land.    Cruel<br/>
	War, that rends the households and the hearts;<br/>
	That makes fond bosoms bleed; and waters all<br/>
	The sod with tears, Salty, agonizing tears, which,<br/>
	When they dry, leave furrows never healing.—<br/>
	Sorrows, never ceasing.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  The mandate came.—<br/>
	Marco must go. What! leave the dear ones all<br/>
	Alone. The gray-haired sire sunning himself<br/>
	Without the cottage door? The little wife in<br/>
	Blooming womanhood? The cherub who in<br/>
	Human form had come to bless his home?<br/>
	Must he leave his treasures and away to<br/>
	Distant shores, perchance, lay clown to die?<br/>
	O! the thought was death itself.     Yet go he<br/>
	Must. Each day he'd wander through the glade,<br/>
	Where every blade and tuft of grass was dear,<br/>
	So dear. All his life from babe to manhood,<br/>
	Here was spent. Here he grew, and loved,<br/>
	And wedded. Here the precious Mother in her<br/>
	Green old age had yielded to the sharp scythe<br/>
	Of the Reaper Death.     Could he leave her?<br/>
	<br/>
	                  The day of<br/>
	Parting came. The sun was high when Marco<br/>
	Rose. The cheery little table decked with snowy<br/>
	Cloth was laid. Out from their frugal hoard<br/>
	Came every dainty Uranne could find.<br/>
	Naught was too good for him. The dear, the<br/>
	Faithful ! He who had done all in human power<br/>
	To make her life joyous.    Truly, she said, as tears<br/>
	Lingered in her eyes, "My lines in pleasant places<br/>
	Have been cast.”<br/>
	<br/>
	                  "Well long they tarried o'er that<br/>
	Meal. It seemed as though 'twould never end,<br/>
	And yet they were not eating. At last the babe<br/>
	Stretched forth its chubby hands and with<br/>
	Infantile speech, broke up the silent meal.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  Marco arose,—<br/>
	Father, adieu. Take care of these as best thou<br/>
	Can 'st. I know the load is much too great for<br/>
	Thee. Whose silvery hairs are whitening o'er with age.<br/>
	Do all thou can'st and leave the rest to ki Him<br/>
	Who notes when e'en the sparrows fall."<br/>
	<br/>
	And now, Uranne ! truest and best, I can<br/>
	Not give thee any more my heart, for thou had'st<br/>
	It all long ago. Thy love to me has been like<br/>
	Silver lining 'mid the clouds of life.<br/>
	Has opened up my heart to kindlier feelings<br/>
	For all who on this earth have naught to cheer.<br/>
	To solace them in hours like these.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  But time doth<br/>
	Fly.    Whether the moments teem with joy or<br/>
	Flit in sorrow.    So Marco said, e're yet I go,<br/>
	Take this bunch of half -blown buds and place<br/>
	Upon your breast, near your heart, and wear<br/>
	Them till I come.    Let naught divide 'twixt<br/>
	Thee and them.    'Mid summer's glow or winter's<br/>
	Cold, loved one, wear them next thy heart.<br/>
	Their very name, Forget-Me-Not, will 'mind<br/>
	Thee of tliv lover-husband.<br/>
	                                      * * *<br/>
	                  Days, weeks,<br/>
	Months passed by.    No tidings yet had<br/>
	Come to them, in that lone village by the sea,<br/>
	Ofttimes the sire would hand-in-hand take<br/>
	Baby for a walk "by the sad, sea waves"—<br/>
	Then would the little one pick up shells<br/>
	And moss, and lisp so sweetly with<br/>
	Infantile grace, that the aged form would<br/>
	Straighten up, as if once more the fires of youth<br/>
	Burned brightly in his- veins; and his old<br/>
	Bereaved heart would leap for joy.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  Alas! when early<br/>
	Spring had come, and the little snowdrops<br/>
	Gleamed in the valley, little Bright-eyes<br/>
	Faded and was laid beneath them.<br/>
	O ! then the sun went down in blackness grim.<br/>
	And the whole world seemed devoid of life;<br/>
	Jfot worth living, the old man cried. And<br/>
	Then he, too, alas! was laid beside the babe.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  All through the long-,<br/>
	Long summer lonely Uranne dwelt. Her heart<br/>
	Low down beneath the Daisies. Uranne, the<br/>
	Pride of him who now, alas! was no more. Perchance<br/>
	He too was sleeping in that far-off land,<br/>
	Without a kindly hand to smooth his aching<br/>
	Brow, or wipe from his cheeks the damp<br/>
	Death dews.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  One morning when the dew<br/>
	Had not yet left the sodden grass,<br/>
	She left the cot to look for her beloved.<br/>
	She sat her down 'mid the dingy rocks, which<br/>
	Girt the shore. The little ripples kissed her feet<br/>
	Caressingly. Long she looked for a white sail,<br/>
	To greet her tired eyes.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  Marco, dost hear Uranne's<br/>
	Call? Wilt thon no more return?    My heart is<br/>
	Breaking with its load. No longer can I wait,—<br/>
	But list! I'll whhisper in thine ear,—<br/>
	     The blue “Forget-Me Nots,<br/>
	     The sweet Forget Me Nots” which thou<br/>
	Did'st place upon my breast.    Thou wilt see them<br/>
	When thou com'st.    None shall them remove.<br/>
	Sweetheart, I keep them till you come.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  There they found her cold<br/>
	And stark.    With hand pressed close to heart<br/>
	Where lay her flowers.    The sounding sea seemed<br/>
	To forget to hurl its billows 'gainst the beach<br/>
	Now- white and shining.    E'en the little ripples<br/>
	Seemed to say, Uranne!     And the great<br/>
	Mountain rocks would echo back, Uranne!<br/>
	<br/>
	                  Years went by. The war, the<br/>
	Cruel war was at an end. And Peace with<br/>
	Flowing mantle had overspread the land;—<br/>
	With anxious heart, but willing feet, the<br/>
	Soldier started for his dear old cabin nestled<br/>
	So snugly in the valley.     Would he And them all?<br/>
	The dear old sire with his silvered hair—Perchance<br/>
	He had lain him down to sleep, beside the wife<br/>
	Who had left him in his prime.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  But she, the dear<br/>
	Uranne, she was there, no doubt of that.    A stronger,<br/>
	Healthier lass ne'er spun the dance.<br/>
	Then the baby, our baby.    How she must have<br/>
	Grown. "Wonder if she remembers me, her own dear<br/>
	Sire?    Who oft would soothe and rock to sleep.<br/>
	O yes; Uranne has taught her to love and lisp<br/>
	My name.<br/>
	<br/>
	                  When the proud vessel dropped her<br/>
	Anchor in the Bay, no prouder man, nor<br/>
	Hopeful, than was Marco.    Lightly he sprang<br/>
	Ashore. He looked to right, to left, no sign of<br/>
	His loved ones cheered his gaze.<br/>
	Uranne, he cried, What! no welcome for Marco?<br/>
	Xo outstretched arms to fold me in love's embrace?<br/>
	He tottered to the cot all overgrown with<br/>
	Weeds and trailing vines.    O ! stars above write<br/>
	On hardest stone, Desolate, forlorn—alone.<br/>
	<br/>
	Unconsciously he moved along the lane<br/>
	That led to the old church -yard.    The little<br/>
	Tuneful bell that had pealed so joyously<br/>
	On his marriage eve, was silent now.<br/>
	He saw no one, nor questions asked.    But<br/>
	Slowly crept to where three mounds were<br/>
	Raised all side by side. He closely scanned<br/>
	Them all, when lo! upon the longest grave,<br/>
	A beauteous tuft of blue Forget-Me-Xots—<br/>
	Aha! he cried, my bright, my blue Forget-Me-Nots!<br/>
	<br/>
	My flowers which I placed upon her breast,<br/>
	And bid her wear till we should meet again,<br/>
	My faithful one.    The seeds matured on thy<br/>
	Dear bosom, nourished by thine own mortality,<br/>
	Pushed their way to the sunlight of earth,    To<br/>
	Cheer and to 'mind of faithful love,<br/>
	Love which lasts even after the gates of<br/>
	Death are passed.    Then he wailed the whole<br/>
	Daylong: Come, O! come! Uranne, come!<br/>
	Like my flowers, leave your bed, too dark too<br/>
	Drear for thee.    Uranne, come to me!<br/>
	Or I will come to thee!<br/>
	 <br/>
	There they found him, there they laid him,<br/>
	With his flowers and Uranne.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MAGNOLIA.<br/>
	<br/>
	Magnolia! "Pale city of the dead,”<br/>
	Adown thy gravelled walks I tread,<br/>
	Thy marble pillars looming high,<br/>
	Thy polished shafts around me lie.<br/>
	With soft, mild rays, the winter sun<br/>
	Thy tortuous pathways doth illume,<br/>
	The weeping-willow droops its head,<br/>
	To crown the "City of the Dead.”<br/>
	<br/>
	On every side death's tracks I see,<br/>
	His footsteps grim encompass me,<br/>
	The high-born here, the lowly there,<br/>
	The proud man there, the humble here.<br/>
	The rich has left his golden hoard,<br/>
	]S"o more he sits at festive board,<br/>
	He could not bribe relentless death,<br/>
	"With all his garnered stores of wealth.<br/>
	<br/>
	Here lies a maiden spotless fair,<br/>
	"Whose claim on life for many a year<br/>
	Seemed sure. Bur the grim Eeaper smiled,<br/>
	And bending, claimed her for his child.<br/>
	So lovingly they made her bed.<br/>
	And tenderly these garlands spread,<br/>
	Bright emblems of a stricken flower,<br/>
	Xow blooming in a sunnier bower.<br/>
	<br/>
	And here an infant's grave I see,<br/>
	Ere sin could stain its purity,<br/>
	It plumed its wings and upward soared,<br/>
	To live forever with its God.<br/>
	Though fair the earth, it would not stay,<br/>
	Much fairer still the land away.<br/>
	Restrain me not, for I would go<br/>
	Where crystal fountains endless flow.<br/>
	<br/>
	With slow, sad steps I press me on<br/>
	To a majestic tower of stone.<br/>
	That tells me they who sleep around<br/>
	Had for their country's weal laid down<br/>
	Their lives. Ah ! many a widowed heart<br/>
	Hath bent and broke with sorrow's dart,<br/>
	For him who now beneath the sod,<br/>
	Yielded his spirit to his God.<br/>
	<br/>
	And many a youth with trappings gay,<br/>
	'Mid martial music liveliest, lay,<br/>
	No more in life returned to bless<br/>
	Their loved ones with a fond caress,<br/>
	But laid them down to their last sleep<br/>
	In stranger land. Now angels keep<br/>
	A loving vigil o'er each grave,<br/>
	And bending branches o'er them wave.<br/>
	<br/>
	City of Shadows! fondly keep<br/>
	The loved who in thy bosom sleep,<br/>
	Shielded from every earthly care,<br/>
	They rest secure and free from fear.<br/>
	Let grasses green and flow'rets bright,<br/>
	Always illume thy paths with light,<br/>
	Till from the heavens loud and clear,<br/>
	Resounds the invitation dear,<br/>
	"Come up and meet me in the air,<br/>
	     My people."<br/>
	<br/>
	 <br/>
	TO MY MOTHER.<br/>
	<br/>
	I took up the burden of life anew<br/>
	     When she, the pure-hearted, died;<br/>
	When the golden cord was rent in twain,<br/>
	     And she faded from my side.<br/>
	When the eyes grew dim that were wont to glow<br/>
	     With the holy light of love,<br/>
	And the spirit, freed from earthly care,<br/>
	     Sped to its rest above.<br/>
	<br/>
	Oh, the dreary days! Oh, the weary nights!<br/>
	     Oh, the anguish, who can tell?<br/>
	When the light of my life went swiftly out,<br/>
	     And the shadow athwart me fell.<br/>
	For the wound was deep, and the woe was great,<br/>
	     And its poignancy will blight<br/>
	All the onward course of my future years,<br/>
	     Till my faith be turned to sight.<br/>
	<br/>
	I muse me now of the beautiful days,<br/>
	     The halcyon days of yore;<br/>
	And wonder if e'er on life's stormy sea<br/>
	     Such days I shall ever see more.<br/>
	The sky is as blue-tinted now as then,<br/>
	     And the sunlight just as bright;<br/>
	But they gladden me not as in other days<br/>
	     Ere she faded from my sight.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	The clouds with their purple and amber hues—<br/>
	     Their gossamer robes of snow—<br/>
	And the stars at the quiet twilight hour<br/>
	     In calm, clear beauty glow.<br/>
	And music sweet as Æolian harp<br/>
	     Is echoing far and wide—<br/>
	But, sure, naught gladdens my heart as before<br/>
	     She faded away from my side.<br/>
	<br/>
	O, Mother! in anguish I peer through the mists<br/>
	     Of a future, so dark without thee;<br/>
	The desert of life hath truly been blessed<br/>
	     "With an oasis sacred to thee.<br/>
	And oft to this green spot of beauty I turn,<br/>
	     My shrine of affection, my pride;<br/>
	For, surely, naught gladdens my heart as before<br/>
	     Thou fadedst away from my side.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	NESTLE-DOWN COTTAGE.<br/>
	<br/>
	As I sit by the ruddy oak fire,<br/>
	     And feel the grateful glow,<br/>
	Come memories sweet of a rustic cot,<br/>
	     That stood near the pebbly shore.<br/>
	<br/>
	With its porch so bright and sunny,<br/>
	     Where the children loved to play,<br/>
	With the sounding shells, from the sandy beach,<br/>
	     All through the summer's day.<br/>
	<br/>
	Where, where are the blessed little ones<br/>
	     Whose childish voices sweet,<br/>
	Who made the sunny porch resound<br/>
	     With the patter of little feet?<br/>
	<br/>
	One where the South Seas wildly break,<br/>
	     And dash on the gleaming sand,<br/>
	Has made Him a home 'mid strangers,<br/>
	     Far, far from his native land.<br/>
	<br/>
	Another, the sweetest and dearest,<br/>
	     Has long 'neatli the daisies been laid,<br/>
	O! dark as a pall was the hour<br/>
	     When they whispered my darling was dead.<br/>
	<br/>
	The cottage still stands by the sea shore,<br/>
	     Our sunny, bright “Nestle-Down,"<br/>
	But we ask so sadly where, O! where<br/>
	     Are the little children gone?<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MOTHER'S RECALL.<br/>
	<br/>
	Come back to me, O ye, my children:<br/>
	     Come back to the home as of yore;<br/>
	As my longing eye peers through the vista of years,<br/>
	     Comes the heart-throbbing more and more.<br/>
	I sit by the casement and listen<br/>
	     To the fall of the soft, sobbing rain,<br/>
	E'en the winds gently sigh as if loth to reply—<br/>
	     In vain, fond mother, in vain.<br/>
	<br/>
	Are ye gone for aye?    Shall I no more hear<br/>
	     The ring and the din of glee?<br/>
	Have my nestlings flown and left me alone?<br/>
	     Shall their faces, I no more see?<br/>
	I sit, and I wait while the days go by,<br/>
	     And the months merge slow into years;<br/>
	Till the twilight deep and the mystic sleep,<br/>
	     And the hopes give place to fears.<br/>
	<br/>
	When the Christmas chimes with its holy rhymes<br/>
	     Ring out o'er the frosty plain,<br/>
	Then I sit, and sigh for the Li Sweet bye and bye"—<br/>
	     But the answer comes, wk Mother in vain."<br/>
	Each one of us, children, have gone forth<br/>
	     To fight out life's battles alone;<br/>
	And the future must prove if your labor of love.<br/>
	     Has, like bread on the waters, been thrown.<br/>
	<br/>
	So the twilight comes — and the fire burns low—<br/>
	     And the day is ebbing fast—<br/>
	Soon the merry chimes and the hallowed rhymes<br/>
	     Will be numbered with the Past.<br/>
	But with hopeful eyes I'll scan the skies,<br/>
	     Perchance, ere next Christmas-tide,<br/>
	Will my children come to their own dear home,<br/>
	     And their place at mother's side.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	DEDICATED<br/>
	TO THE RIGHT REV'D D. A. PAYNE.<br/>
	<br/>
	Ohl! surely 'tis a theme sublime<br/>
	     That stirs my soul to-day;<br/>
	Awake then, muse nor slumber more,<br/>
	     Till sung the wondrous lay.<br/>
	My song shall be of one, whose youth<br/>
	     And strength were freely given<br/>
	To elevate, instruct, and lead<br/>
	     Benighted souls to heaven.<br/>
	<br/>
	My song shall be of him, whose hand<br/>
	     A mother's taste did mould;<br/>
	Whose precepts noble were to her<br/>
	     As apples of pure gold.<br/>
	I'll tell of one whose virtues rare<br/>
	     In modesty enshrined;<br/>
	Who bears a lasting laurel wreath<br/>
	     About his brow entwined.<br/>
	<br/>
	Who in the days that tried men's souls<br/>
	     Did ne'er from duty quail,<br/>
	But wrought on ensign, lifted high,<br/>
	     There's no such word as fail!<br/>
	Mem'ries so sweet are hov'ring round,<br/>
	     That I, with Psalmist, say<br/>
	“O! had I wings like turtle dove,<br/>
	     Quickly I'd fly away!”<br/>
	<br/>
	Away, away beyond the hills<br/>
	     Where blooms the tree of life,<br/>
	Where limpid streams whose silent flow,<br/>
	     Ne'er stir the sea of strife.<br/>
	Oh! Bishop, Pastor, Friend, may'st thou<br/>
	     To green old age be spared;<br/>
	Then, like a fully ripened ear<br/>
	     Go to thy rich reward.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	OCTOBER.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Bright and beautiful art thou,<br/>
	     Autumn flowers crown thy brow,<br/>
	     Golden-rod and Aster blue,<br/>
	     Russet leaf with crimson hue.<br/>
	     Half stripped branches waving by,<br/>
	     Softly as a lullaby,<br/>
	     Tell of summer's days gone by,<br/>
	     Tell that winter's very nigh.<br/>
	<br/>
	     In the forest cool and chill,<br/>
	     Sadly moans the Whippoorwill,<br/>
	     Not as in the summer days,<br/>
	     When he gloried in his lays.<br/>
	     Lower-toned, but sweet and clear,<br/>
	     Like thy crisp and fragrant air,<br/>
	     Warbling forth with voice sublime,<br/>
	     This is nature's harvest time.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Crickets chirp amid the leaves,<br/>
	     Squirrels hop among the trees,<br/>
	     Brown nuts falling thick and fast,<br/>
	     On the dewy, dying grass,<br/>
	     Glowing sun with softer rays,<br/>
	     Harbinger of wintry days,<br/>
	     Tell the year is going by,<br/>
	     Sighing forth its lullaby.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE DYING GIRL.<br/>
	<br/>
	Sister darling, ope the window, let the balmy air once more<br/>
	Fan my flushed and throbbing brow as in the happy days of yore;<br/>
	I would gaze again in rapture on the brightly setting sun<br/>
	For I know, my gentle sister, that the goal is almost won.<br/>
	<br/>
	See the crimson clouds are hov'ring round the glorious orb of day,<br/>
	And the far-off hills are basking in its golden, garnished ray:<br/>
	Listen to yon forest warbler hymning sweet and joyous lay,<br/>
	Chanting forth its evening vespers to the sinking god of day.<br/>
	<br/>
	But sister, time is waning, after all it doth but seem<br/>
	That life is but a toilsome march, a weariness, a dream;<br/>
	And yet I do not murmur, for if all the joys of earth<br/>
	Had not faded from my vision ere they ripened into birth,<br/>
	<br/>
	If the shadows had not thickened as they clustered round my brow,<br/>
	Had I not turned from the altar, where I worshipped long ago,<br/>
	Perchance I might have reveled full too deep in human love,<br/>
	And forgotten God, my Maker, and my happy home above.<br/>
	<br/>
	So 'tis well, and now I'm going to join that spirit band,<br/>
	With their never-ceasing music, making glad that starry land;<br/>
	And I'm glad too, for I'm weary, and would rest me from my woe—<br/>
	Fain would land my stricken spirit on the banks of "Evermore."<br/>
	<br/>
	And O! my dearly loved one, when sorrows round thee press,<br/>
	Hurling each deadly missile on thy pure and youthful breast—<br/>
	Then think upon thy dear one, O! may ne'er thy footsteps rove!<br/>
	But meet me, surely meet me, in that happy home above.<br/>
	                                  * * *<br/>
	Wight's shades huns* o'er the valleys and obscured the forest green—<br/>
	'Twas o'er; that happy spirit had been robed in spotless sheen,<br/>
	So they laid her 'mong the flowers, and the zephyr's tuneful play<br/>
	Resounds a woodland recpiiem at the sunset of each clay.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	ALASKA.<br/>
	<br/>
	     With thy rugged, ice-girt shore,<br/>
	     Draped in everlasting snow,<br/>
	          Thou'rt enthroned a queen.<br/>
	     Crown of moss and lichen grey,<br/>
	     Frosted o'er with ocean spray,<br/>
	     All thy long, long wintry day,<br/>
	          Dark and stern thy mien.<br/>
	<br/>
	     From the cloudland fresh and fair,<br/>
	     Falls the snow through crispy air,<br/>
	          Mantling vale and hill.<br/>
	     Then old “Borealis" glows,<br/>
	     With his fiery light that shows,<br/>
	     Frozen nature in repose.<br/>
	          River, stream and rill.<br/>
	<br/>
	     On thy north the Polar Sea<br/>
	     Thunders forth in wild melee,<br/>
	          'Mid gorges dark and steep<br/>
	     Full many a ship with noble crew,<br/>
	     Lies low beneath thy waters bine,<br/>
	     Nor left behind a single clew,<br/>
	          But sleep a dreamless sleep.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Beside the far famed Yukon stands<br/>
	     Hundreds of men from distant lands,<br/>
	          All with the same desire<br/>
	     Gold, gold's the watchword, yellow ore,<br/>
	     That tempts him from his homestead door,<br/>
	     And Oh! alas he nevermore<br/>
	          May sit by household fire.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Ah! if men would only toil,<br/>
	     Dig and delve their own rich soil,<br/>
	          With vigor and with vim;<br/>
	     Forth would spring the golden corn,<br/>
	     Loud would ring the harvest song,<br/>
	     Life and health they would prolong,<br/>
	          All through nature's prime.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Under his own, his fruitful vine,<br/>
	     Beneath his laden fig tree green,<br/>
	          He, like a king, would reign.<br/>
	     Bending low with purple yield,<br/>
	     Rivalling fair Eschkol’s fields,<br/>
	     He'd a potent influence wield,<br/>
	          With his corn and wine.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	ON PARTING WITH A FRIEND.<br/>
	<br/>
	Can I forget thee?    No, while mem'ry lasts,<br/>
	     Thine image like a talisman entwined,<br/>
	Around my heart by sacred friendship's ties<br/>
	     Remains unchanged, in love, pure love, enshrined.<br/>
	<br/>
	Can I forget thee?    Childhood's happy hours<br/>
	     Would like some flitting phantom mock and jeer;<br/>
	Life's sunny hours, would quickly lose their charm,<br/>
	     If Lethe's slumbrous waves but touched me there.<br/>
	<br/>
	Can I forget thee ? 'Tis a sad, sad thought,<br/>
	     That friend from friend should thus be ruthless riven—<br/>
	But list, methinks, a sweet voice whispers low,<br/>
	     Remember, no adieus are spoke in heaven.<br/>
	<br/>
	Can I forget thee ?    No, though ocean's waves<br/>
	     May madly leap and foam 'twixt you and me,<br/>
	Still o'er my stricken heart this yearning will remain,<br/>
	     Nor time estrange my love, dear one, from thee.<br/>
	<br/>
	And though on earth again we never more may meet,<br/>
	     In that bright Elysian where spirits, holy, dwell,<br/>
	May we in concert with that transported throng,<br/>
	     Unite, ne'er more (rapt thought) to say ''farewell!'<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	TWILIGHT MUSINGS.<br/>
	<br/>
	I'm sitting by the hearthstone now,<br/>
	     And my heart is lone and drear;<br/>
	It seems as though the autumn blast<br/>
	     Had left its impress there.<br/>
	As memory, backward, wends its way,<br/>
	     Unfolding to my gaze<br/>
	Those joyful hours of “Auld Lang Syne,”<br/>
	     Those lights of by-gone days.<br/>
	<br/>
	I'm musing on the past, when I<br/>
	     In childhood's thoughtless play,<br/>
	Reveled in gladness, joy and mirth,<br/>
	     Nor deemed one saddening ray<br/>
	Should ever cloud my gladsome heart,<br/>
	     Or cause deep sorrow's moan—<br/>
	Ne'er dreaming of the time, alas!<br/>
	     When I'd be quite alone.<br/>
	<br/>
	I've listened to the morning's song<br/>
	     Of nature's feathered gems,<br/>
	Long ere Aurora's roseate hue<br/>
	     Illumined Orient's realms,<br/>
	And as their carols wafted high<br/>
	     On balmy zephyrs borne,<br/>
	'Tis then I muse, and sadly feel,<br/>
	     That I am quite alone.<br/>
	<br/>
	I've never heard the ocean's roar,<br/>
	     Or felt its quivering thrill;<br/>
	Nor, on stern Neptune's bosom been,<br/>
	     When all was calm and still—<br/>
	But o'er my heart, at times, there are<br/>
	     Such stormy billows borne,<br/>
	That then I sadly, truly feel,<br/>
	     That I am quite alone.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	SONG TO ERIN.<br/>
	<br/>
	Oh! Erin my country, my ancestor's home!<br/>
	Impelled by my wants, I, from thee, had to roam;<br/>
	And now my heart yearneth, sore longeth for thee<br/>
	My dear native Ireland, my "gem of the sea."<br/>
	<br/>
	Oh! Erin my country, thou land of the brave!<br/>
	Who'll rescue from tyr'ny, who'll ransom and save?<br/>
	Thy despots so strong, are still wielding their power,<br/>
	To bind thee in slavery both now and forever.<br/>
	<br/>
	Speak! speak! who will rescue our Emerald Isle?<br/>
	Now bowed by the oppressor in servitude vile!<br/>
	Her sons are all scattered, her daughters are gone,<br/>
	And she is left desolate, forlorn and alone.<br/>
	<br/>
	I‘ll sigh for thee Erin, when spring winds doth fan,<br/>
	With musical breathings, this far distant land;<br/>
	‘Twill remind me of youth's happy days on thy shore—<br/>
	Of days, mournful thought, I shall never see more.<br/>
	<br/>
	I'll weep for thee Erin, as tlie blue waters surge,<br/>
	Shall re-eclio my wailing, sliall chant the sad dirge;<br/>
	Of Ireland in slavery, once land of the free;<br/>
	Of Ireland, my country, my "gem of the sea."<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE VALENTINE.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Lady with thine eyes of beauty<br/>
	          Rivaling cerulean flowers,<br/>
	     Where the love- beams seem to linger,<br/>
	          Throughout youth's bright, sunny hours.<br/>
	<br/>
	     With thy smile of witching sweetness<br/>
	          Like the magnet's mystic art,<br/>
	     Charming oft enchanting oft'ner,<br/>
	          Drawing to thee every heart.<br/>
	<br/>
	     But, fair lady, I'll no longer<br/>
	          Linger thus o'er nature's mould,<br/>
	     ‘Tis thy spirit's beauty charms me,<br/>
	          More than mines of Peru's gold.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Like an exile who hath wandered<br/>
	          Far from kindred and from home,<br/>
	     Pants and longs once more to greet them,<br/>
	          Never more on earth to roam;—<br/>
	<br/>
	     Like the tempest-tossed, the weary,<br/>
	          Who of earth ne'er had their part,<br/>
	     Fain would land their stricken spirits<br/>
	          Where heart answers unto heart;—<br/>
	<br/>
	     So this bosom when overflowing<br/>
	          With some latent, deadly grief,<br/>
	     Loves to revel in the music<br/>
	          Of thy voice to find relief.<br/>
	<br/>
	     And when joys do hover 'round me,<br/>
	          Weaving chaplets rich and bright,<br/>
	     I'd away from pleasures turn me<br/>
	          To my beautiful "Starlight."<br/>
	<br/>
	     Lady! could I seal thy future,<br/>
	          All of bliss and love 'twould be;<br/>
	     And when time with us is ended,<br/>
	     Spend eternity with thee.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	LINES TO FLORENCE.<br/>
	<br/>
	I am sitting sad and lonely<br/>
	     Where I've often sat before,<br/>
	And I am musing, fondly musing<br/>
	     Of my Florence who pass'd o'er.<br/>
	Pass'd into the realms supernal,<br/>
	     Far 'bove cloud-lands lofty height;<br/>
	Yonder 'mid the fields Elysian,<br/>
	     Dwells my “Flor" ‘mong saints of light.<br/>
	<br/>
	'Twas when autumn leaves were falling,<br/>
	     'Twas when harvest days had come,<br/>
	That, King Death, the mighty reaper,<br/>
	     Came to take my darling home.<br/>
	When the winds were softly sighing,<br/>
	     Zephyrs breathing low and deep,<br/>
	Lulled to rest by such sweet music,<br/>
	     My bright treasure fell asleep.<br/>
	<br/>
	Closely clasped to mother's bosom<br/>
	     On the well-nigh bursting breast,<br/>
	Lay the early stricken floweret,<br/>
	     Lay the heart so near its rest.<br/>
	And those little eyes upturning,<br/>
	     Brimful with their wealth of love,<br/>
	Mutely, though with earnest language,<br/>
	     Said, I'm hastening up above.<br/>
	<br/>
	Well, ere long, they said my darling<br/>
	     Had this earth exchanged for heaven—<br/>
	She had upward spread her pinions,<br/>
	     Leaving hearts with anguish riven.<br/>
	Yes;    the autumn's wind so plaintive,<br/>
	     With its music soft and deep,<br/>
	Woo'd my birdie from my bosom,<br/>
	     And she sweetly fell asleep.<br/>
	<br/>
	But when time with me is over,<br/>
	     When my fleeting years have passed,<br/>
	Oh ! I trust once more to greet her,<br/>
	     And this parting be the last;<br/>
	So, till then I wait expectant—<br/>
	     I, the Master's time doth ''bide”—<br/>
	But to me the hour is precious,<br/>
	     That my little Florence died.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	"BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON."<br/>
	<br/>
	By the Rivers of Babylon we mournfully bent,<br/>
	With " harps on the willows” and vesture all rent,<br/>
	For burdened by sorrow and saddened by pain,<br/>
	We felt that we no more could strike them again.<br/>
	<br/>
	This, this is a strange land, we will not then sing<br/>
	One song of our Zion, the home of our King,<br/>
	No rather let right hand its cunning forget,<br/>
	Than we to our loved home as recreants act.<br/>
	<br/>
	O! City of God, though as captives we go,<br/>
	Jerusalem's weal we'll never forego,<br/>
	O! soon may the exiles of Israel return,<br/>
	To sing Zion's songs in their own holy land.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE PEN.<br/>
	<br/>
	Mightier than the sword thou art,<br/>
	Thou can'st pierce like venomed dart,<br/>
	Time and space count naught with thee,<br/>
	Leagues of land or leagues of sea.<br/>
	<br/>
	Thou can'st waves of passion calm,<br/>
	Griefs assuage like Gilead's balm,<br/>
	Bring sweet pleasure to the eye,<br/>
	Give sweet gladness for the sigh.<br/>
	<br/>
	When thy little point is prest,<br/>
	Oft it wounds some gentle breast,<br/>
	Filling chalice to the brim,<br/>
	Darkening life with sorrows grim.<br/>
	<br/>
	Learned sage in days gone by,<br/>
	Scanned thee with prophetic eye,<br/>
	Said to myriads then unborn<br/>
	Thou would 'st rule on many a throne.<br/>
	 <br/>
	Swords may stab with savage ire,<br/>
	Glistening out like rays of fire,<br/>
	They can ne'er thy power attain,<br/>
	O'er the sea or o'er the main.<br/>
	<br/>
	Mightier than the sword art thou,<br/>
	Lo! on many a regal brow<br/>
	Furrows which thy point has wrought,<br/>
	Troubles which thy work has brought.<br/>
	<br/>
	Mightier than the sword art thou,<br/>
	List! a maid records her vow,<br/>
	That so long as life shall last,<br/>
	Ne'er a doubt shall love o'ercast<br/>
	<br/>
	Naught of bliss or naught of woe,<br/>
	But thou can'st on man bestow,<br/>
	With thy tiny pointed prow,<br/>
	Mightier than the sword art thou.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	PASSING OF THE OLD YEAR.<br/>
	<br/>
	Ah! the year is slowly dying,<br/>
	And the wind in tree-top sighing,<br/>
	     Chant his requiem.<br/>
	Thick and fast the leaves are falling,<br/>
	High in air wild birds are calling,<br/>
	     Nature's solemn hymn.<br/>
	<br/>
	In the deep, dark forest lingers,<br/>
	Imprints of his icy lingers,<br/>
	     Chill, and dark, and cold.<br/>
	And the little streamlets flowing,<br/>
	Wintry sun so softly glowing,<br/>
	     Through the maple's gold.<br/>
	<br/>
	So, Old Year, gird on your armor,<br/>
	Let not age, nor fear, nor favor,<br/>
	     Hurry you along.<br/>
	List! the farewell echoes pealing,<br/>
	List! the midnight hour is stealing,<br/>
	     Hark! thy dying song.<br/>
	<br/>
	Say, Old Year, ere yet your death knell<br/>
	Rings from out yon distant church bell,<br/>
	     Say, what have yon done?<br/>
	Tell of hearts you've sadly broken,<br/>
	Tell of love dead and unspoken,<br/>
	     Ere your course is run.<br/>
	<br/>
	Tell the mother who doth languish,<br/>
	O'er her graves in silent anguish,<br/>
	     She will see again.<br/>
	Blooming bright "beyond the river”<br/>
	Living on for aye and ever,<br/>
	     Every bright-eyed gem.<br/>
	<br/>
	Ah! full many a spirit weary,<br/>
	You have wooed from paths so dreary,<br/>
	     Wafted them above.<br/>
	Now they say Old Year we bless thee,<br/>
	Raise thy head, we would caress thee<br/>
	     For this home of love.<br/>
	<br/>
	On thy brow lies many a furrow,<br/>
	And thy eyes tell many a sorrow<br/>
	     Hath its shadow cast.<br/>
	But thy task is almost ended,<br/>
	Soon the path which thou hast wended,<br/>
	     Will be called the "Past.”<br/>
	<br/>
	Then, old dying year we hold thee,<br/>
	To our hearts we fondly fold thee,<br/>
	     Ere the midnight bell.<br/>
	Soon thy race will now be ende,<br/>
	With Eternity be blended,<br/>
	     So, Old Year, farewell.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	SONNET TO MY FIRST BORN.<br/>
	<br/>
	Oh! waves in the sunlight gleaming,<br/>
	     Oh! billows w r ith ceaseless roar,<br/>
	Bring back to this aching heart of mine,<br/>
	     The laddie you bore long ago.<br/>
	Far out on on your restless bosom,<br/>
	     Far away from his boy-hood's home,<br/>
	I charge you waves of the deep, blue sea<br/>
	     To bid my wanderer come.<br/>
	<br/>
	Oh! stars in the heavens twinkling<br/>
	     Like lamps hung up in the sky,<br/>
	Oh! moon look do wn through the darkness,<br/>
	     His try sting-place you may descry.<br/>
	Then tell him a fond heart is aching,<br/>
	     In love for the dear one she bore,<br/>
	Oh! surely to thee he will hearken,<br/>
	     And haste to his own cottage door.<br/>
	<br/>
	The winds of the autumn are sighing,<br/>
	     The leaves from the trees falling fast,<br/>
	The roses that erstwhile were blooming,<br/>
	     Say mournfully—Summer is past.<br/>
	The daisies have long ago slumbered,<br/>
	     Their blossoms I search for in vain;<br/>
	But surely for thee I will look, love,<br/>
	     Ere spring time brings them again.<br/>
	<br/>
	When the Frost-King's robe is glistening<br/>
	     O'er hill, and valley, and glen,<br/>
	When the bright sleigh-bells are jingling,<br/>
	     I know he'll come to me then.<br/>
	So sunlight, or starlight, or moonlight,<br/>
	     Wherever my truant you see,<br/>
	Just tell him you left me a-waiting<br/>
	     Far over the deep blue sea.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	LINES TO --------------<br/>
	<br/>
	O come to me in my dreams love!<br/>
	     When the world is wrapped in sleep,<br/>
	And the silver moon like virgin queen,<br/>
	     Her lonely vigils keep.<br/>
	When all is hushed in calm repos —<br/>
	     The earth, and sky, and sea,<br/>
	Then hasten love to this far-off land,<br/>
	     And dwell one hour with me.<br/>
	<br/>
	O come to me in my dreams love!<br/>
	     And cheer me on my way;<br/>
	And bid me look to a higher land<br/>
	     For the dawn of a brighter day.<br/>
	Then breathe to heaven an earnest prayer<br/>
	     To bless, ere you depart,<br/>
	With perfect love and childlike faith,<br/>
	     This sad, despondent heart.<br/>
	<br/>
	O, do not forget to come, love,<br/>
	     But on rosy pinions haste,<br/>
	And deluge my willing ear, with<br/>
	     Mementoes of the past.<br/>
	And tell me, too, of that distant land,<br/>
	     Its sunshine and its flowers;<br/>
	And in return my strain shall be<br/>
	     Magnolia's bright bowers.<br/>
	<br/>
	Ah, do not fail to come love,<br/>
	     For I'll woo my slumber to-night;<br/>
	I'll lay me down to sweet repose,<br/>
	     And wait for thee and light.<br/>
	Then hie to my bower on wings of love,<br/>
	     Ah, linger not by the way,<br/>
	But solace this heart and bid it hope,<br/>
	     For the dawn of a brighter day.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	HIGHLAND MARY.<br/>
	<br/>
	Will you leave the hills of Scotland?<br/>
	     Your childhood's happy home,<br/>
	To brave the dangers of the deep,<br/>
	     In foreign lands to roam—<br/>
	Say, Mary, will you, for my sake<br/>
	     Leave yonder joyous cot—<br/>
	Your youthful friends and scenes so dear,<br/>
	     To share a soldier's lot?<br/>
	<br/>
	The battle's din, my Mary,<br/>
	     Has never met thine ear,<br/>
	The woodlands' songsters melody<br/>
	     Is all that thou dost hear.<br/>
	The vivid flash of musketry—<br/>
	     The cannon's thundering roar<br/>
	Must meet thine eye, burst on thine ear<br/>
	     Sounds never heard before.<br/>
	<br/>
	And now, fond one, I've told you all.<br/>
	     And I can say no more—<br/>
	“Will you go to the Indies, my Mary,<br/>
	     And leave old Scotia's shore?”<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE CHEROKEE.<br/>
	<br/>
	‘Twas a cloudless morn and the sun shone bright,<br/>
	     And dewdrops sparkled clear;<br/>
	And the hills and the vales of this Western land<br/>
	     Were wreathed with garlands rare.<br/>
	For verdant spring with her emerald robe<br/>
	     Had decked the forest trees;<br/>
	Whilst e'er and anon the vine-clad boughs<br/>
	     Waved in the playful breeze.<br/>
	<br/>
	All, all was still, not a sound was heard,<br/>
	     Save the music of each tree,<br/>
	As gracefully it bent and bowed<br/>
	     Its branches o'er the lea.<br/>
	But hark! a sound, 'tis the Red mail's tread,<br/>
	     Breaks on the silent air;<br/>
	And a sturdy warrior issues forth,<br/>
	     Robed in his native gear.<br/>
	<br/>
	And wandering on, he neared the brook;<br/>
	     Then sat him down to rest;<br/>
	'Twas a noble sight—that warrior free—<br/>
	     That Monarch of the West.<br/>
	He gazed around. O! a wistful gaze<br/>
	     Saddened his upturned brow,<br/>
	As he thought of those he'd fondly loved,<br/>
	     Of those now laid so low.<br/>
	<br/>
	He mused aloud “Great Spirit!” list<br/>
	     To the Indian's earnest plea;<br/>
	And tell me why, from his own loved home,<br/>
	     Must the Indian driven be.<br/>
	When the "Pale Face" came to our genial clime,<br/>
	     We wondered and were glad;<br/>
	Then hied us to our chieftain's lodge,<br/>
	     Our noble “Flying Cloud.”<br/>
	<br/>
	We told him all, and he calmly said<br/>
	     He'd gladly give them place;<br/>
	And if friends they proved, perchance, extend<br/>
	     The calumet of peace.<br/>
	But soon, alas! the dread truth rang<br/>
	     That the Pale Face was our foe;<br/>
	For he made our warriors bite the dust—<br/>
	     Our children lie so low.<br/>
	<br/>
	So now, my own, dear, sunny land,<br/>
	     Each, woodland and each dell,<br/>
	Once the Indian's home, now the Indian's grave,<br/>
	     I bid a last farewell.<br/>
	To the “Great Spirit's" hunting-ground,<br/>
	     To meet my long-lost bride,<br/>
	My "Raven Wing" I gladly hie—<br/>
	     He said, then calmly died.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	RALLY SONG.<br/>
	<br/>
	Come, let us join this festal lay—<br/>
	     Hurra, Hurra,<br/>
	Come, let us join this festal lay,<br/>
	And let our anthems all be gay,<br/>
	And sing aloud for this glad day<br/>
	     Should brighten every heart:—<br/>
	<br/>
	We'll sing of heroes who have fought—<br/>
	     Hurra, Hurra,<br/>
	We'll sing of heroes who have fought,<br/>
	Who to their country's altar brought,<br/>
	And on her sacred ensign wrought,<br/>
	     The tree of liberty.<br/>
	<br/>
	We'll sing of martyrs who have died—<br/>
	     Hurra, Hurra,<br/>
	We'll sing of martyrs who have died,<br/>
	From severed ranks, as side by side<br/>
	They bravely stemmed the gory tide.<br/>
	     To ransom brother man.<br/>
	<br/>
	Our glorious banner's now unfurled—<br/>
	     Hurra, Hurra,<br/>
	Our glorious banner's now unfurled,<br/>
	May it soon wave o'er all the world,<br/>
	And every traitor standard hurled<br/>
	     From pinnacle to earth.<br/>
	<br/>
	With gifted leaders in our van—<br/>
	     Hurra, Hurra,<br/>
	With gifted leaders in our van,<br/>
	The bright and noblest of our land,<br/>
	Let patriots shout, as, hand in hand,<br/>
	     They welcome this glad day.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	SERENADE.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Sleep, love sleep,<br/>
	     The night winds sigh,<br/>
	     In soft lullaby.<br/>
	     The Lark is at rest<br/>
	     With the dew on her breast,<br/>
	<br/>
	     So close those dear eyes,<br/>
	     That borrowed their hue<br/>
	     From the heavens so blue,<br/>
	     Sleep, love sleep.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Sleep, love sleep,<br/>
	     The pale moon looks down<br/>
	     On the valleys around,<br/>
	     The Glow Moth is flying,<br/>
	     Th South wind is sighing,<br/>
	     And I am low lying,<br/>
	     With lute deftly strung,<br/>
	     To pour out my song,<br/>
	     Sleep, love sleep<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE COMING WOMAN.<br/>
	<br/>
	Just look, 'tis a quarter past six, love—<br/>
	     And not even the flies are caught;<br/>
	Well, you know I must be at the office—<br/>
	     But, as usual, the breakfast’ll be late.<br/>
	<br/>
	Now hurry and wake up the children;<br/>
	     And dress them as fast as you can;<br/>
	"Poor dearies,” I know they'll be tardy,<br/>
	     Dear me, “what a slow, poky man!”<br/>
	<br/>
	Have the tenderloin broiled nice and juicy—<br/>
	     Have the toast browned and buttered all right;<br/>
	And be sure you settle the coffee:<br/>
	     Be sure that the silver is bright.<br/>
	<br/>
	When ready, just run up and call me—<br/>
	     At eight, to the office I go,<br/>
	Lest poverty, grim, should overtake us—<br/>
	     “‘Tis bread and butter," you know.<br/>
	<br/>
	The bottom from stocks may fall out,<br/>
	     My bonds may get below par;<br/>
	Then surely, I seldom could spare you<br/>
	     A nickel, to buy a cigar.<br/>
	<br/>
	All ready? Now, while I am eating,<br/>
	     Just bring up my wheel to the door;<br/>
	Then wash up the dishes; and, mind now.<br/>
	     Have dinner promptly at four;<br/>
	<br/>
	For to-night is our Woman's Convention,<br/>
	     And I am to speak first, you know—<br/>
	The men veto us in private,<br/>
	     But in public they shout, “That's so."<br/>
	<br/>
	So "by-by"—In case of a rap, love,<br/>
	     Before opening the door, you must look;<br/>
	O! how could a civilized woman<br/>
	     Exist, without a man cook.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	ODE TO PEACE.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Come Peace, on snowy pinions,<br/>
	          Come, nestle like a dove;<br/>
	     Encircle earth's dominions<br/>
	          With harmony and love.<br/>
	     Let anger, pride and malice,<br/>
	          And strife forgotten lie;<br/>
	     Nor from tlieir venomed chalice,<br/>
	          Quaff more bitter draughts and die.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Come Peace, with arms extended,<br/>
	          Come, brood o'er this fair land;<br/>
	     Let battle scenes be ended,<br/>
	          And heart be joined with hand.<br/>
	     Let fields now crimsoned over,<br/>
	          With the life-blood of the brave,<br/>
	     Loom as monuments of warning,<br/>
	          Shine, as beacon lights to save.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Come Peace, a welcome waits thee,<br/>
	          From many a stricken life;<br/>
	     And many a heart-crushed mourner,<br/>
	          Now weary of the strife;<br/>
	     Methinks e'en now a footfall<br/>
	          Breaks like music on my ear,<br/>
	     As the distant sound of gladness,<br/>
	          When 'tis borne on summer's air.<br/>
	<br/>
	     May the echoes prove prophetic;<br/>
	          May thy murmurs from afar<br/>
	     Shed a radiance as refulgent,<br/>
	          Beam as bright as Bethlehem's Star.<br/>
	     And the hearts that have been riven,<br/>
	          And the bosoms that have bled,<br/>
	     Soon will change their griefs to gladness,<br/>
	          Yield to God and earth their dead.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	A REVERIE.<br/>
	<br/>
	Yon may speak of a grave in a distant land,<br/>
	     Or of one 'neath ocean's foam,<br/>
	Where the dolphins play o'er the sunny spray,<br/>
	     Far from the dear old home;<br/>
	"Where the coral peaks form a glorious tomb,<br/>
	     And the mighty waters lave,<br/>
	But there is naught in the wide world sought<br/>
	     Like the heart's deep anguished grave.<br/>
	<br/>
	You may tell of a grave 'neath the burning sands<br/>
	     Of the tropics fevered zone;<br/>
	Where silence reigns o'er the desert plains<br/>
	     So desolate, so forlorn.<br/>
	Where the lion's roar is the liveliest sound<br/>
	     That o'er that waste is heard—<br/>
	And the forest bird hymns a plaintive lay,<br/>
	     A requiem for the dead.<br/>
	<br/>
	Again you may tell of a grave unsought<br/>
	     Far from the home of youth;<br/>
	Where the willow weeps as the exile sleeps<br/>
	     Akin to Mother Earth.<br/>
	But O! methinks, there's not a woe<br/>
	     That can the bosom cleave,<br/>
	Or as deeply wound, as the lowly mound<br/>
	     O'er the heart's deep, anguished grave.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	SUNSET.<br/>
	<br/>
	     All hail! thou gorgeous sunset,<br/>
	          With thy gold and purple clouds,<br/>
	     Tinting the vast horizon,<br/>
	          Like shadowy, fleecy shrouds.<br/>
	<br/>
	     The mountain crests are glowing,<br/>
	          The hills are crimson dyed,<br/>
	     The very air seems blushing,<br/>
	          Bathed in thy amber tide.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Soon the twilight shadows falling<br/>
	          Will thy glory chase away,<br/>
	     And weary man will welcome<br/>
	          The closing of the day.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Then the moon in silvery brightness,<br/>
	          Will show her pale, sad face;<br/>
	     And the stars as her attendants,<br/>
	          Will stud infinite space.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Low down amid the valley<br/>
	          Soon we'll hear the night-bird's song,<br/>
	     Calling softly to the south wind,<br/>
	          That the day of toil is done.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Then hail! thou glorious sunset,<br/>
	          Who in fullness can portray<br/>
	     The varied, wondrous beauty<br/>
	          Of a summer's sunset day.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE PAST.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Past it is fraught with many a feeling<br/>
	     Of pleasure, of sadness, of joy, and of pain;<br/>
	And 'tis sweet of an eve when dewdrops are falling,<br/>
	     To reflect on the days that can ne'er come again.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Past, it is pleasant ! Ah, memory recalls<br/>
	     The period of childhood, when joyous and free,<br/>
	With innocence crowned, in purity robed,<br/>
	     We revelled in gladness and sported in glee.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Past, it is saddening ! full many a loved one<br/>
	     That joined in each pleasure, partook of each pain,<br/>
	Have passed on before, to the spirit land flown,<br/>
	     And left us below, till their prize we attain.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Past's irrevocable ! every word we've spoken,<br/>
	     Or action committed, been stamp 'd with its seal<br/>
	Immortal, enduring, 'twill stand sure forever,<br/>
	     As no time can efface, nor effulgence reveal.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then, then, should the Present be valued and used<br/>
	     As a boon from the Author and Giver of gifts;<br/>
	That so, when 'tis past, we could always enjoy<br/>
	     The pleasant assurance of its being well spent.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MARRIAGE.<br/>
	<br/>
	     The die is cast, come weal, come woe,<br/>
	          Two lives are joined together,<br/>
	     For better or for worse, the link<br/>
	          Which naught but death can sever.<br/>
	     The die is cast, come grief, come joy.<br/>
	          Come richer, or come poorer,<br/>
	     If love but binds the mystic tie,<br/>
	          Blest is the bridal hour.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	FOR WHO?<br/>
	<br/>
	When the heavens with stars are gleaming<br/>
	     Like a diadem of light,<br/>
	And the moon's pale rays are streaming,<br/>
	     Decking earth with radiance bright;<br/>
	When the autumn's winds are sighing,<br/>
	     O'er the hill and o'er the lea,<br/>
	When the summer time is dying,<br/>
	     Wanderer, wilt thou think of me?<br/>
	<br/>
	When thy life is crowned with gladness.<br/>
	     And thy home with love is blest,<br/>
	Not one brow o'ercast with sadness,<br/>
	     Not one bosom of unrest—<br/>
	When at eventide reclining,<br/>
	     At thy hearthstone gay and free,<br/>
	Think of one whose life is pining,<br/>
	     Breathe thou, love, a prayer for me.<br/>
	<br/>
	Should dark sorrows make thee languish,<br/>
	     Cause thy cheek to lose its hue.<br/>
	In the hour of deepest anguish,<br/>
	     Darling, then I'll grieve with you.<br/>
	Though the night be dark and dreary,<br/>
	     And it seemeth long to thee,<br/>
	I would whisper, “be not weary;”<br/>
	     I would pray love, then, for thee.<br/>
	<br/>
	Well I know that in the future,<br/>
	     I may cherish naught of earth;<br/>
	Well I know that love needs nurture,<br/>
	     And it is of heavenly birth.<br/>
	But though ocean waves may sever<br/>
	     I from thee, and thee from me,<br/>
	Still this constant heart will never,<br/>
	     Never cease to think of thee.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	JUNE.<br/>
	<br/>
	     I am the month when roses<br/>
	          Bloom brightest o'er the glade,<br/>
	     I am the month when marriages<br/>
	          I lost happily are made.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Mine is the time of foliage,<br/>
	          When hills and valleys teem<br/>
	     With buds and vines sweet scented,<br/>
	          All clothed in glowing green.<br/>
	<br/>
	     My nights are bright and starry,<br/>
	          My days are long and clear<br/>
	     And truly I'm the fairest,<br/>
	          Of all months in the year.<br/>
	<br/>
	     With night dews gently falling,<br/>
	          With bees upon the wing,<br/>
	     And tiny rills soft rippling<br/>
	          Amid the valleys sing.<br/>
	<br/>
	     The farmer with his ploughshare,<br/>
	          Swift turning up the sod,<br/>
	     His brawny arms at labor,<br/>
	          His soul with Nature's God.<br/>
	<br/>
	     The Lark with sweetest carol,<br/>
	          Doth greet the rising sun,<br/>
	     The Mock-bird at the even,<br/>
	          Loud whistles day is done.<br/>
	<br/>
	     O! I'm the month of beauty,<br/>
	          The summer's crown I claim,<br/>
	     Now whisper to me softly,<br/>
	          And tell me what's my name.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	TRIBUTE TO A LOST STEAMER.<br/>
	<br/>
	O! sing ye a dirge for the loved and the lost,<br/>
	     That have found them a home 'neath the coral reefs deep;<br/>
	That have laid them to rest 'neath the murmuring surge,<br/>
	     Where the whistling wind wails o'er their sweet, but sad sleep.<br/>
	<br/>
	They have gone to their home—their last resting-place<br/>
	     The blue waves embraced and called them their own;<br/>
	While the depths of the sea and the billows thereof<br/>
	     Are mournfully sighing their sad requiem.<br/>
	<br/>
	Down, down through the mass of the waters they sped,<br/>
	     Amid the dark chambers so mystic, so drear;<br/>
	'Till perchance they selected some ruby-lit bed,<br/>
	     To sleep their last sleep 'mid jeweled gems rare.<br/>
	<br/>
	O! 'tis sweet now to ponder, though many have gone<br/>
	     To that far-off bourne whence no traveller returns,<br/>
	That the sea shall not always their bodies retain,<br/>
	     For Jehovah hath said, she must yield them again.<br/>
	<br/>
	One bright little jewel outlived the dark storm,<br/>
	     So fatal to many, yet—blissful to tell—<br/>
	His “Father in heaven" preserved him from harm,<br/>
	     O, parent rejoice! with your Louis 'tis well.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	A REQUIEM.<br/>
	<br/>
	O, insatiable monster! Could’st thou not<br/>
	In pity turn aside thy venom ed shaft<br/>
	From her my gifted, darling friend?<br/>
	Has sympathy within thy breast<br/>
	No trysting place? That thou must come<br/>
	At spring-time when the flowerets bloom<br/>
	To bear my loved one to the tomb?<br/>
	<br/>
	So young was she; life's woes had not yet dimmed<br/>
	The joyous sunshine of her girlhood's days;<br/>
	She did not quaff the dregs of time,<br/>
	But, like some rosebud prematurely culled,<br/>
	She sped away, and o'er her grave<br/>
	So peacefully the willows wave,<br/>
	And dewdrops, her calm bosom lave.<br/>
	<br/>
	Tread not the earth where sleeps my loved one's form;<br/>
	But place it lightly on her marble brow.<br/>
	Bid birdies sing at set of sun<br/>
	To gladden Fannie’s lowly home;<br/>
	Bid rippling springs with shining spray,<br/>
	And sylvan notes and songsters lay<br/>
	Unite, to chase the gloom away.<br/>
	<br/>
	Blest child! she did not tarry long, and yet,—<br/>
	O, happy thought—she did not live in vain,<br/>
	If truly she did seek and find<br/>
	The “Pearl of Price," that precious boon,<br/>
	Then ne'er to her could come too soon<br/>
	The summons to an early tomb.<br/>
	<br/>
	Blest child, rest! while gentle zephyrs breathe<br/>
	Their fragrance through the waving trees;<br/>
	All nature decked in gorgeous array<br/>
	Is reveling now, but soon alas!<br/>
	Like thee, 'twill fade.    The autumn's knell<br/>
	Will ere long peal like funeral bell<br/>
	Its dirge like sounds, "Friend, fare thee well."<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE GRAFTED BUD.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Life's stormy surge had scarcely touched<br/>
	          Her blooming, beauteous brow.<br/>
	When rudely torn from earthly bliss,<br/>
	     A budded, broken flower.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Methinks I see her brilliant eye,<br/>
	          When smiles played softly there,<br/>
	     As gentle as the summer's breeze,<br/>
	          So radiant, sweet and clear.<br/>
	<br/>
	     But ah! frail nature gave away,<br/>
	          And she was doomed to die,<br/>
	     So young in years, so bright, so fair.<br/>
	          In the cold grave to lie.<br/>
	<br/>
	     So to the realms of light and life<br/>
	          Her uncaged spirit fled;<br/>
	     There to remain until the trump<br/>
	          Shall sound to wake the dead.<br/>
	<br/>
	     There with the Saviour she abides,<br/>
	          There tunes the sacred lyre,<br/>
	     Regardless of th' impending day,<br/>
	          And dreading not its ire.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	TO A LOVED ONE.<br/>
	<br/>
	          I'll think of thee, mine own, dear one<br/>
	                    As morn's first blushing ray<br/>
	          Diffuses light o'er the dim earth—<br/>
	                    Turns darkness into day.<br/>
	<br/>
	          I'll think of thee at eve, my love,<br/>
	                    When moon and star appear—<br/>
	          When in the horizon of my hope<br/>
	                    All, all is bright and clear.<br/>
	<br/>
	          I'll think of thee when joy doth cast<br/>
	                    Its gladness o'er my heart,<br/>
	          As peace, and love and happiness<br/>
	                    Seem new life to impart.<br/>
	<br/>
	          I'll think of thee when dark shades fall<br/>
	                    Athwart my fevered brow;<br/>
	          When low in death I hear thee lisp—<br/>
	                    "I'm waiting for thee now."<br/>
	<br/>
	          I'll think of thee, my darling one.<br/>
	                    While I have life and breath;<br/>
	          And seal the assurance fervently,<br/>
	                    I'll think of thee in death.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE NATIVITY.<br/>
	<br/>
	The gloom of night had overspread the land,<br/>
	Swaying its dread sceptre o'er every man;<br/>
	For superstition like a monarch reigned,<br/>
	And Adam's sons were fettered by its chain.<br/>
	<br/>
	When the fulfilment of the promise came,<br/>
	A Saviour! born to-day in Bethlehem;<br/>
	Gabriel, the news, the joyful news revealed<br/>
	By night, to some poor shepherds in the field.<br/>
	 <br/>
	Go now to Bethlehem, behold the Babe—<br/>
	Though Lord of all, He's in a manger laid!<br/>
	Among the horned cattle there you'll find<br/>
	The Prince of Peace, the Saviour of mankind.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Shepherds then in haste obeyed his word.<br/>
	Guided by flaming star to view their Lord;<br/>
	They entered in, when, judge of their surprise—<br/>
	An infant, a Redeemer, burst upon their eyes.<br/>
	<br/>
	Amazed, affrighted, trembling, they<br/>
	Gazed on the Babe as there He lay;<br/>
	Though in a manger yet He bore<br/>
	Rare tokens of Almighty power.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	TO THE MOCK-BIRD.<br/>
	<br/>
	Bird of the woodland, sing me a song,<br/>
	Fain would I list to thee, all the day long.<br/>
	Out from thy cosy nest, 'mid leafy bower,<br/>
	Lift high thy tuneful voice—'tis summer's hour.<br/>
	<br/>
	Bird of the forest, with voice sublime,<br/>
	Gladdening with thy music all summer time,<br/>
	E'en while the Autumn's winds bend low the trees,<br/>
	Sweetly still thy carols float with the breeze.<br/>
	<br/>
	Queen of the song-realm, what doest thou?<br/>
	Up amid the leaflets, rocking on the bough,<br/>
	Ah! little trickster, building thee a nest,<br/>
	Cosy, soft and warm, for thy wee ones to rest.<br/>
	<br/>
	Bird of the south-land, haste thee and bring<br/>
	Tributes of thy melody, welcoming the spring,<br/>
	Say to sombre winter—up and away,<br/>
	This my time of minstrelsy, bright, sunny May<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	IN MEMORIAM<br/>
	REV. SAMUEL WESTON.<br/>
	<br/>
	Oh! surely for thee were the gates ajar,<br/>
	     As thy chariot onward sped,<br/>
	When with brightened eye and youth renewed,<br/>
	     Triumphant thou did'st tread<br/>
	Through the gates of death, to the portals bright,<br/>
	     While the ransomed myriads sing,<br/>
	"Lift up your heads, ye Golden Gates,"<br/>
	     Let the aged pilgrim in.<br/>
	<br/>
	No terrors for thee had the darksome vale,<br/>
	     For like the wise virgins of old,<br/>
	Thou keep'st thy lamp burning and trimmed from thy youth,<br/>
	     Till three-score and ten were well told.<br/>
	And oft, as a shepherd, that tends his flock,<br/>
	     Thou did'st then to still waters lead,<br/>
	And 'mid the green pastures of justified grace,<br/>
	     Thou lovedst thy children to feed.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then Pastor and Leader, fond Parent, adieu,<br/>
	     Till the last, grand trump shall sound,<br/>
	When shepherd and flock united once more,<br/>
	     Shall echo a long harvest home.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	TO REV. THADDEUS SALTUS.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Sleep, Christian warrior, sleep,<br/>
	          Life's fitful dream is o'er,<br/>
	     Thy pain-tossed bark is anchored<br/>
	          Safe on the golden shore.<br/>
	     ‘Neath the green sward we lay thee<br/>
	          Thus early to thy rest,<br/>
	     And press the sod thus lightly,<br/>
	          Upon thy gentle breast.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Though but in manhood's prime,<br/>
	          When the dread summons came,<br/>
	     To hush the voice so well attuned<br/>
	          To preaching  “In His Name."<br/>
	     Thou did'st not murmur, but with joy<br/>
	          Obeyed the Master's word,<br/>
	     And rapture crowned did'st enter<br/>
	          The palace of thy Lord.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Then sweetly sleep, dear Rector,<br/>
	          Thy grave we'll deck with flowers,<br/>
	     An earnest of that Better Land<br/>
	          Of ever blooming bowers.<br/>
	     Around this spot a halo twines,<br/>
	          While angels vigils keep,<br/>
	     And we rejoice that thus "He gives<br/>
	          To His beloved sleep."<br/>

	TRIBUTE TO<br/>
	CAPT. F.W. DAWSON<br/>
	<br/>
	Carolina mourns to-day.    For he, the gifted<br/>
	Son of her adoption, is no more.    The voice<br/>
	That stirred the bosoms of her sons, and<br/>
	Made her ramparts ring from mount to<br/>
	Sea-board, is hushed in death.   His<br/>
	Noble form, and nobler mien that<br/>
	Never faltered 'mid the cannon's<br/>
	Roar, lies motionless.<br/>
	<br/>
	So Carolina weeps.     'Tis meet she should—<br/>
	Her chieftain lieth low.     In this<br/>
	Grand, old City by the Sea, this Venice<br/>
	Of the Southland.     The home he loved<br/>
	So well.     When the grey morn breaks,<br/>
	And when the twilight lingers, they<br/>
	Chant in low, sweet music, evening<br/>
	Vespers for his soul.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then, Carolinians, build a monument for him;<br/>
	But not on marble cold.     Not on<br/>
	Towering dome or polished shaft,<br/>
	Should his memory be engraved.     But<br/>
	In the hearts of those he loved and<br/>
	Served, should immortelles, perpetual, bloom;<br/>
	And incense, fragrant, ever rise<br/>
	To his memory.<br/>
	                          Requiescat in Pace.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MRS. LOUISE B. WESTON.<br/>
	<br/>
	     My Mother! With the angels now,<br/>
	          Life's race completely run;<br/>
	     The Pilgrim's cross is laid aside,<br/>
	          The Christian's crown is won.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Full two-score years has thy frail bark<br/>
	          Relentlessly been driven,<br/>
	     Along the rugged shoals of time—<br/>
	          Now safely moored in heaven.<br/>
	<br/>
	      Some vision bright of Eden's land—<br/>
	          Some glimpse from Nebo's crest—<br/>
	     So ravished thy enraptured soul,<br/>
	          Then panting for its rest,<br/>
	<br/>
	     That when the City bathed in gold<br/>
	          Full burst upon your sight,<br/>
	     You would not tarry with us more;<br/>
	          Your spirit took its flight.<br/>
	<br/>
	     My Mother, when life's sands run low,<br/>
	          In love, in kindness come,<br/>
	     And take the spirit of thy child,<br/>
	          And bid her “welcome home.”<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	LINES TO MRS. ISABEL PEACE.<br/>
	<br/>
	'Tis said but a name is friendship,<br/>
	     Soulless, and shallow, and vain;<br/>
	That the human heart ne'er beats in response,<br/>
	     Or echoes sweet sympathy's strain.<br/>
	<br/>
	But to-day in "memory's mirror"<br/>
	     Came a dear and honored one.<br/>
	Whom in days gone by had lived and had loved.<br/>
	     Ere her heavenly goal was won.<br/>
	<br/>
	Her countenance beamed as of yore,<br/>
	     With radiant smiles of love,<br/>
	And I felt that the friendship she lavished me here,<br/>
	     Had ripened in heaven above.<br/>
	<br/>
	I felt that her voice so winsome,<br/>
	     Attuned to holier rhymes,<br/>
	Would in soft cadence tell of friendship's truth,<br/>
	     Like harp of a thousand strings.<br/>
	<br/>
	Rise up and call her blest!<br/>
	     Ye children of her love,<br/>
	For a friendlier hand or a kindlier heart<br/>
	     Ne'er entered the mansions above.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	In Memoriam.<br/>
	ALPHONSE CAMPBELL FOKDHAM.<br/>
	Aged 6 Years, 2 Months, 20 Days.<br/>
	<br/>
	          Almost whose last words were<br/>
	          "We shall meet beyond the River."<br/>
	<br/>
	     Yes, my darling, when life's shadows<br/>
	          Over me do darkly fall,<br/>
	     Meet me surely at the river<br/>
	          As I haste to obey the call.<br/>
	     Gladly through the darksome valley,<br/>
	          Through its portals, grim and cold,<br/>
	     Will I hasten 'till my nestling<br/>
	          Meets me at the "Gates of Gold."<br/>
	<br/>
	     Sadly do I miss my wee one,<br/>
	          None can till thy vacant place,<br/>
	     Only in my dreams I fold thee,<br/>
	          Only then behold thy face.<br/>
	     See thee in thy childish beauty,<br/>
	          Clasp thy little hand in mine,<br/>
	     Ever will those moments chain me,<br/>
	          Ever in my heart enshrined.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Little Heartsease, “bud of promise”<br/>
	          Broken off in early morn,<br/>
	     Now can sin no more pollute thee<br/>
	          In the angels' bosom borne.<br/>
	<br/>
	     In that land no pain or anguish<br/>
	          Ever can my child enfold,<br/>
	     Then my darling meet thy mother<br/>
	          Surely at the "Gates of Gold.”<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MR. EDWARD FORDHAM.<br/>
	<br/>
	     When the Autumn's breezes<br/>
	          Were sweeping o'er the land,<br/>
	     Came the mighty mandate<br/>
	          From the upper land.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Now from pain and anguish<br/>
	          Thou hast found relief,<br/>
	     Passed through death's dark portal,<br/>
	          Left this world of grief.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Now thou’rt safely anchored<br/>
	          In the port aboye,<br/>
	     Gladly do we offer thee<br/>
	          Symbols of our loye.<br/>
	<br/>
	     When the welcome summons<br/>
	          Shall echo through the skies,<br/>
	     Then our ransomed brother<br/>
	           Will hear the word “Arise.”<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Death of a Grandparent.<br/>
	MRS. JENNETTE BONNEU.<br/>
	<br/>
	Rest thee aged pilgrim, now thy toils are o'er;<br/>
	Peacefully thou'st landed over Jordan's shore;<br/>
	Safe from all the sorrows, free from all the strife,<br/>
	Thon hast passed death's portals, entered into life.<br/>
	<br/>
	Doubtless thou wert weary, tempest tossed so long;<br/>
	Doubtless thou wert longing to join the happy throng;<br/>
	Doubtless many loved ones on the other shore,<br/>
	Whispered to thee softly “Stay on earth no more.”<br/>
	<br/>
	Whispered thee, come higher, where perennial bloom<br/>
	Shall with heightened luster its wonted sway resume.<br/>
	“Come where peaceful rivers quietly do flow—<br/>
	Hasten mother, hasten, from that world of woe."<br/>
	<br/>
	Then to fields Elysian she joyfully did soar,<br/>
	In the blest land of Canaan to dwell forever more;<br/>
	All through the “Golden City” she happily doth roam,<br/>
	Oft wondering why she stay'd so long away from home.<br/>
	<br/>
	So 'neath the bending willows we've laid thee down to rest,<br/>
	Well knowing thou'rt reposing secure on Jesus' breast;<br/>
	Well knowing that one day will come, the welcome word Arise,<br/>
	Come up, thou ransomed mortal, to thy Saviour in the skies.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	QUEENIE.<br/>
	<br/>
	For one brief day, did Queenie stay<br/>
	     To brighten each, fond heart,<br/>
	Then sped like dove to realms above,<br/>
	     Ne'er more to feel death's dart.<br/>
	<br/>
	O! in that land, where infants stand<br/>
	     Arrayed in spotless sheen,<br/>
	No griefs to share, nor sorrows bear,<br/>
	     No death to intervene.<br/>
	<br/>
	We would not care, nay, would not dare<br/>
	     To wish thee back again,<br/>
	Nay, rather say, ''Queenie, good day,<br/>
	     Till we your rest attain."<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	TO AN INFANT.<br/>
	<br/>
	Just as the twilight's holy hour<br/>
	     In quietude so deep,<br/>
	Was hushing nature to repose,<br/>
	     Our "Charlie" fell asleep.<br/>
	<br/>
	Just in the bloom of infancy,<br/>
	     We laid him to his rest,<br/>
	Well knowing that our angel boy<br/>
	     Was numbered with the blest.<br/>
	<br/>
	Well knowing that the Saviour said<br/>
	     Oh! suffer such to come,<br/>
	“Forbid them not," for they are Mine,<br/>
	     And heaven is their home.<br/>
	<br/>
	So bow we to God's gracious will,<br/>
	     For he was lent, not given;<br/>
	And let this cheer our drooping hearts,<br/>
	     Our Charlie is in heaven.<br/>
	<br/>

	SUSAN EUGENIA BENNETT.<br/>
	<br/>
	When the Sabbath was declining, just at twilight's mystic hour,<br/>
	Left the u Upper Courts" an angel, sent to cull our sweetest flower,<br/>
	Not in judgment, not in anger, did this white-winged seraph come,<br/>
	But to lead a little Pilgrim through Death's Portal to her home.<br/>
	<br/>
	And our angel child was ready, aye, and anxious to depart—<br/>
	Not the slightest doubt o'ershadowed her trusting little heart;<br/>
	But with a brow as radiant as rainbow in the sky,<br/>
	She whispered softly "Mother, I'm not afraid to die."<br/>
	<br/>
	When shall these little, weary limbs lie down to sweet repose,<br/>
	'Mid the green, the verdant pastures where the limpid water flows;<br/>
	When shall I the Golden City sparkling in its beauty see,<br/>
	"When shall it be, my Saviour, O! when shall I be free?”<br/>
	<br/>
	Ere the week-day with its labors, its duties and its care—<br/>
	Was ushered in, our darling was found on earth no where;<br/>
	But with the saints in glory, and the Saviour she adored,<br/>
	She's happy and at rest, for aye and ever with the Lord.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MRS. REBECCA WESTOX.<br/>
	<br/>
	"For so He giveth His beloved sleep."<br/>
	<br/>
	     She is not dead, but sleepeth;—<br/>
	          Ere long will the morning break,<br/>
	     When those we love who sleep in Him,<br/>
	          Shall from the dust awake.<br/>
	<br/>
	     She is not dead, but sleepeth;—<br/>
	          Soon, soon will the ransomed sing<br/>
	     O! grave, where is thy victory?<br/>
	          O! death, where is thy sting?<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	MRS. E. COHRS BROWN.<br/>
	<br/>
	Tread not the earth where lies her youthful form,<br/>
	Grow violets, sweet violets, above that cherished mound;<br/>
	Bid zephyrs softly whisper in accents sweet and low,<br/>
	Not dead, not lost, but only gone a little while before.<br/>
	<br/>
	So, I, though bowed in anguish, yield her spirit to its God,<br/>
	And meekly clasp the smiting hand, and kiss the chast'ning rod;<br/>
	May I, when time is over, greet thee on the other shore,<br/>
	To live and love for aye and aye, where partings are no more.<br/>

	MRS. MARY FURMAN WESTON BYRD.<br/>
	Obituary.<br/>
	<br/>
	     BYRD. — "As one who wraps the drapery of his<br/>
	couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams, ' ' thus<br/>
	sweetly passed from earth to glory, on the morning of<br/>
	the 19th of February, 1884, Mrs. Mary Furman<br/>
	Weston Byrd, in the 92d year of hex age, leaving two<br/>
	children, twelve grand-children, and twenty great-<br/>
	grandchildren, to mourn her irreparable loss.<br/>
	     "Rising up they call her blessed." Another<br/>
	ancient landmark has been gathered to her<br/>
	Fathers. With her death a link is severed which<br/>
	bound two centuries together. The venerable subject<br/>
	of this notice was born in 1792, of parents who were<br/>
	both e riles from their native land; one being born in<br/>
	Morocco, Barbary States, the other in Marseilles,<br/>
	France. During her eventful life she passed throng<br/>
	three wars; that of 1812 in her girlhood, after the<br/>
	Mexican and the late Civil Wars. Possessed of a<br/>
	loving heart and cheerful disposition, charity was the<br/>
	guiding star of her life. Her widow's mite was never<br/>
	faund wanting. In her the distressed and the needy<br/>
	met always a ready response. She died as she lived,<br/>
	beloved and venerated by legions to whom her very<br/>
	name was a household word. So then,<br/>
	 <br/>
	     Though no blossoms cluster<br/>
	          Above thy aged brow,<br/>
	     Though winter winds are breathing<br/>
	          A requiem soft and low,<br/>
	     We look beyond earth's shadows,<br/>
	          Beyond death's misty plain.<br/>
	     And though we sadly miss thee,<br/>
	          Will not wish thee back again.<br/>
	<br/>
	     Could we but see thee, dear one,<br/>
	          In the Palace of thy Lord,<br/>
	     With thy robe of snowy whiteness,<br/>
	          And with more than youth renewed.<br/>
	     No more on bended willows<br/>
	          Would our broken harps remain,<br/>
	     Take us beauty for our ashes,<br/>
	          Take us gladness for our pain.<br/>

v#O Earth, adore creative power,
v#That made and gave to man as dower,
v##This world of beauty rare,
v#With hills and vales of verdant green,
v#With rills and brooks of crystal sheen,
v##Lovely beyond compare.
</p>
<p>
v#O Sun, bright ruler of the day,
v#When first thy power thou did'st display,
v##Earth must have shrank in fear,
v#When like a meteor burst thy light,
v#Turning to day the long, long night,
v##With radiance wondrous fair.
</p>
<p>
v#Thou Moon, pale sister of the Sun,
v#When he his daily work has done,
v##Thou comest forth a queen;
v#A queen in silvery robe adorned,
v#With tiara of jewels formed,
v##Of starry orbs unseen.
</p>
<p>
v#Ye twinkling stars of milder light,
v#Though now ye gleam like sapphires bright,
v##Across yon azure dome,
v#The day will dawn, that last dread day,
v#When from yon heaven you'll fall away,
v##And man to Judgment come.
</p>
<p>
v#Thunder and Lightnings burst and gleam,
v#Frightful and fierce to us they seem
v##Rending the darkened sky.
v#Like giants tread the thunder's peal,
v#The vivid lightnings swiftly steal,
v##And men in terror fly.
</p>
<p>
v#O filmy clouds, of purest white,
v#With robes of gossamer cased in white,
v##Ye floating waters pure,
v#Sometimes to burst in cooling showers,
v#Sometimes to deluge wintry hours
v##With your relentless pour.
</p>
<p>
v#Thou beauteous Rainbow bursting forth,
v#With varied hues encircling earth;
v##The sign to Noah made.
v#“I place amid the Clouds my Bow”
v#To show that I will nevermore
v##Deluge with angry flood.
</p>
<p>
v#Mountains and Hills whose snow capped tops
v#The vast horizon overlooks,
v##Pyramids strung and sure;
v#Nor lightnings fierce nor earthquake shock
v#Can ever sway, for firm as rock
v##Ye ever will endure.
</p>
<p>
v#Thou Ocean vast, oftimes thy breast,
v#Is calm and still as if at rest,
v##Like one in quiet sleep;
v#But soon in anger thou may'st roar,
v#And madly toss from shore to shore,
v##And human harvest reap.
</p>
<p>
v#Fountains and Rivulets so clear,
v#That gush amid the valleys fair,
v##With soft and mellow ring;
v#As coming forth from glade and wood
v#Your babblings whisper “God is good,”
v##Ye make the vales to sing.
</p>
<p>
v#Now when all nature swells the song,
v#When beast and birds the strain prolong,
v##Shall man from praise refrain?
v#Then would the rocks and hills proclaim,
v#All nature crying out for shame,
v#They who their Maker's image wear,
v#Should shout and sing till rent the air
v##With rhapsodies sublime.

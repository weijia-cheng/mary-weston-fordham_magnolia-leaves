				<span>O Earth, adore creative power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made and gave to man as dower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This world of beauty rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hills and vales of verdant green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rills and brooks of crystal sheen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lovely beyond compare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Sun, bright ruler of the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first thy power thou did'st display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Earth must have shrank in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When like a meteor burst thy light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning to day the long, long night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With radiance wondrous fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Moon, pale sister of the Sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he his daily work has done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou comest forth a queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A queen in silvery robe adorned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tiara of jewels formed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of starry orbs unseen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye twinkling stars of milder light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though now ye gleam like sapphires bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across yon azure dome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The day will dawn, that last dread day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from yon heaven you'll fall away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And man to Judgment come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thunder and Lightnings burst and gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frightful and fierce to us they seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rending the darkened sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like giants tread the thunder's peal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vivid lightnings swiftly steal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And men in terror fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O filmy clouds, of purest white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With robes of gossamer cased in white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye floating waters pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to burst in cooling showers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to deluge wintry hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With your relentless pour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou beauteous Rainbow bursting forth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With varied hues encircling earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sign to Noah made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I place amid the Clouds my Bow”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To show that I will nevermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deluge with angry flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mountains and Hills whose snow capped tops</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast horizon overlooks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pyramids strung and sure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor lightnings fierce nor earthquake shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can ever sway, for firm as rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye ever will endure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Ocean vast, oftimes thy breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is calm and still as if at rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like one in quiet sleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soon in anger thou may'st roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And madly toss from shore to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And human harvest reap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fountains and Rivulets so clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gush amid the valleys fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With soft and mellow ring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As coming forth from glade and wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your babblings whisper “God is good,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye make the vales to sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now when all nature swells the song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When beast and birds the strain prolong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall man from praise refrain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would the rocks and hills proclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All nature crying out for shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They who their Maker's image wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should shout and sing till rent the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rhapsodies sublime.</span>

				<span>O Earth, adore creative power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made and gave to man as dower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This world of beauty rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hills and vales of verdant green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rills and brooks of crystal sheen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lovely beyond compare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Sun, bright ruler of the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first thy power thou did'st display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Earth must have shrank in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When like a meteor burst thy light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning to day the long, long night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With radiance wondrous fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Moon, pale sister of the Sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he his daily work has done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou comest forth a queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A queen in silvery robe adorned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tiara of jewels formed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of starry orbs unseen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye twinkling stars of milder light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though now ye gleam like sapphires bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across yon azure dome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The day will dawn, that last dread day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from yon heaven you'll fall away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And man to Judgment come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thunder and Lightnings burst and gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frightful and fierce to us they seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rending the darkened sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like giants tread the thunder's peal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vivid lightnings swiftly steal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And men in terror fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O filmy clouds, of purest white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With robes of gossamer cased in white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye floating waters pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to burst in cooling showers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to deluge wintry hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With your relentless pour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou beauteous Rainbow bursting forth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With varied hues encircling earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sign to Noah made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I place amid the Clouds my Bow”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To show that I will nevermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deluge with angry flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mountains and Hills whose snow capped tops</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast horizon overlooks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pyramids strung and sure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor lightnings fierce nor earthquake shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can ever sway, for firm as rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye ever will endure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Ocean vast, oftimes thy breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is calm and still as if at rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like one in quiet sleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soon in anger thou may'st roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And madly toss from shore to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And human harvest reap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fountains and Rivulets so clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gush amid the valleys fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With soft and mellow ring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As coming forth from glade and wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your babblings whisper “God is good,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye make the vales to sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now when all nature swells the song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When beast and birds the strain prolong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall man from praise refrain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would the rocks and hills proclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All nature crying out for shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They who their Maker's image wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should shout and sing till rent the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rhapsodies sublime.</span>

			<p>
				<span>The earth was young, the world was fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And balmy breezes filled the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nature reposed in solitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When God pronounced it "very good."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The snow-capped mountain reared its head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deep, dark forests widely spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O'er pebbly shores the stream did play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On glad creation's natal day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But silence reigned, nor beast nor bird</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had from its mate a whisper heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E'en man, God's image from above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not, to Eve, tell of his love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where the four rivers met there strayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man and wife, no whit afraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the arch-fiend expelled from heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not yet found his way to Eden.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But lo! a light from 'mid the tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But hark! a rustling 'mongst the leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then a fair Angel from above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descending, sang his song of love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forth sprang the fierce beasts from their lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright feathered songsters fill the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All nature stirred to centre rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the celestial song began.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Lion, monarch of the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First tried to imitate the strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shaking high his mane he roared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till beast and bird around him cohered.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The little Linnet tuned her lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lark, in turn, did welcome day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cooing soft, the timid Dove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did to his mate tell of his love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Eve, the synonym of grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew nearer to the solemn place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard the words to music set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In tones so sweet, she ne'er forgot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The anthems from the earth so rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Higher and higher filled the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Seraphs caught the inspiring strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And morning stars together sang.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then laggard Adam sauntered near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What Eve had heard he too must hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ah! for aye will woman's voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make man to sigh or him rejoice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Only the fishes in the deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not arouse them from their sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So they alas! did never hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Angel's visit to this sphere.</span>

				<span>For have they ever said one word</span>

				<span>He mused aloud, Oh! Italy!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Land of the chivalric, the free!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bruce may of Scotland tune his lyre.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But thee alone, can'st me inspire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Birthplace of beauty! never more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall I behold thy vine-clad shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sward where I in childhood play'd—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The haunts deep in the forest shade—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The place where, mould' ring in decay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ashes of a sire lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Why did I leave thee? As spring flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Return no more through summer hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When once they blossom, bear and die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more will bloom neath sultry sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So heart of man when hopes have fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And love lies buried with the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No second spring time sends one ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To cheer his path through life's dark day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hope's blossoms like the early dew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once passed away, naught can renew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still I live on, and oft, at eve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My isolated cot I leave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence to this lonely nook I hie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take a glance at days gone by.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each blue wave hastening to its goal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Fit type of the immortal soul)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In thrilling accents seems to say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou'rt nearing fast life's closing day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou soon wilt reach thy better home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The home where changes never come.</span>

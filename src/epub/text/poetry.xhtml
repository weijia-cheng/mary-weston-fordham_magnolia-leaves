			<p>
				<span>O Earth, adore creative power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made and gave to man as dower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This world of beauty rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hills and vales of verdant green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rills and brooks of crystal sheen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lovely beyond compare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Sun, bright ruler of the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first thy power thou did'st display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Earth must have shrank in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When like a meteor burst thy light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning to day the long, long night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With radiance wondrous fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Moon, pale sister of the Sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he his daily work has done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou comest forth a queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A queen in silvery robe adorned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tiara of jewels formed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of starry orbs unseen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye twinkling stars of milder light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though now ye gleam like sapphires bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across yon azure dome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The day will dawn, that last dread day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from yon heaven you'll fall away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And man to Judgment come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thunder and Lightnings burst and gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frightful and fierce to us they seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rending the darkened sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like giants tread the thunder's peal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vivid lightnings swiftly steal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And men in terror fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O filmy clouds, of purest white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With robes of gossamer cased in white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye floating waters pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to burst in cooling showers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to deluge wintry hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With your relentless pour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou beauteous Rainbow bursting forth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With varied hues encircling earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sign to Noah made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I place amid the Clouds my Bow”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To show that I will nevermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deluge with angry flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mountains and Hills whose snow capped tops</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast horizon overlooks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pyramids strung and sure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor lightnings fierce nor earthquake shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can ever sway, for firm as rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye ever will endure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Ocean vast, oftimes thy breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is calm and still as if at rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like one in quiet sleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soon in anger thou may'st roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And madly toss from shore to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And human harvest reap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fountains and Rivulets so clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gush amid the valleys fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With soft and mellow ring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As coming forth from glade and wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your babblings whisper “God is good,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye make the vales to sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now when all nature swells the song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When beast and birds the strain prolong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall man from praise refrain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would the rocks and hills proclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All nature crying out for shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They who their Maker's image wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should shout and sing till rent the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rhapsodies sublime.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Shipwreck</h2>
			<p>
v#Night and a starless sky,
v#Ship on wild billows tost,
v#With tattered sails and opening seams.
v#And deck bestrewn with falling beams.
v##Swift plunging to her doom.
</p>
<p>
v#Red lightnings round her flash,
v#Loud thunders crash and roar,
v#And the noble vessel mounts the crest
v#Of the reeking waves, then sinks to rest
v##Mid carnival of woe.
</p>
<p>
v#The Petrel soars aloft,
v#Trailing her hymn of death,
v#And the dirge like sounds pierce the blackened sky,
v#While the crew send forth one anguished cry,
v##Sinking to lowest depth.
</p>
<p>
v#Some ships go out to sea
v#That never more return,
v#Souls that from heaven in infancy come,
v#Tarnished and ruined by sin may become,
v#Like the Dove to the Ark they never return,
v##But sink as ship to doom.

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Washerwoman</h2>
			<p>
v#With hands all reddened and sore,
v##With back and shoulders low bent,
v#She stands all day, and part of the night
v##Till her strength is well-nigh spent.
v#With her rub — rub — rub,
v##And her wash, rinse, shake,
v#Till the muscles start and the spirit sinks,
v##And the bones begin to ache.
</p>
<p>
v#At morn when the sunbeams scatter
v##In rays so golden and bright,
v#She yearns for the hour of even,
v##She longs for the restful night.
v#Still she rubs — rubs — rubs,
v##With the energy born of want,
v#For the larder's empty and must be filled,—
v##The fuel's growing scant.
</p>
<p>
v#As long as the heart is blithesome.
v##Will her spirit bear her up,
v#And kindness and love imparteth a zest
v##To sweeten hard life's bitter cup.
v#But to toil—toil—toil,
v##From the grey of the morn till eve,
v#Is an ordeal so drear for a human t o bear,
v##Which the rich can hardly conceive.
</p>
<p>
v#What part in the world of pleasure?
v##What holidays are her own?
v#For the rich reck not of privations and tears,
v##Saying, "she is to the manoi born.”
v#So dry those scalding tears
v##That furrow so deeply thy cheek,
v#For rest — rest — rest
v##Will come at the end of the week.
</p>
<p>
v#Yes, even on earth there's a day
v##When labor and toil must cease,
v#The world at its birth received the mandate
v##Of the seventh day of rest.
v#When the sweet-toned Sabbath bells
v##Break o'er the balmy air,
v#Then sing—sing—sing
v##That the morning stars may hear.
</p>
<p>
v#For the frugal table spread,
v##For the crust and the humble bed,
v#When He to whom all earth belongs
v##Had not where to lay His head,
v#Then toil for thy daily bread,
v##Let thy heart like thy hands be clean,
v#And rub—rub—rub
v##Till thy hones all ache, I ween.
</p>
<p>
v#With hands all reddened and sore,
v##With back and shoulders bent low,
v#Thou hast for thy comfort that rest, sweet rest,
v##Will be found on the other shore.
v#Then they who've washed their souls
v##Will dip in the crystal tide
v#Of the fountain clear that was oped to man
v##From the Saviour's wounded side.

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Snowdrop</h2>
			<p>
v#How comest thou, O flower so fair,
v#To bud and bloom while wintry air
v##Still hovers o'er the land?
</p>
<p>
v#How comest from the cold, dark earth?
v#That fostered thee and gave thee birth,
v##Studding thy brow with snow.
</p>
<p>
v#Say, didst thou yearn for sunny bowers?
v#To gladden with thy pure, pale flowers,
v##The valley and the hill?
</p>
<p>
v#Down in the darkness whence thou came,
v#Hear'st aught of passion, fashion, fame,
v##Or even greed for gold?
</p>
<p>
v#And when the old earth's bosom heaves,
v#And scatters man like autumn's leaves.
v##With its low thundered voice,
</p>
<p>
v#Thou sleep'st serene with eyelids closed,
v#No earthquake shock breaks thy repose,
v##Till comes the breath of Spring.

				<span>O Earth, adore creative power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made and gave to man as dower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This world of beauty rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hills and vales of verdant green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rills and brooks of crystal sheen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lovely beyond compare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Sun, bright ruler of the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first thy power thou did'st display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Earth must have shrank in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When like a meteor burst thy light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning to day the long, long night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With radiance wondrous fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Moon, pale sister of the Sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he his daily work has done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou comest forth a queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A queen in silvery robe adorned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tiara of jewels formed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of starry orbs unseen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye twinkling stars of milder light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though now ye gleam like sapphires bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across yon azure dome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The day will dawn, that last dread day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from yon heaven you'll fall away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And man to Judgment come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thunder and Lightnings burst and gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frightful and fierce to us they seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rending the darkened sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like giants tread the thunder's peal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vivid lightnings swiftly steal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And men in terror fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O filmy clouds, of purest white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With robes of gossamer cased in white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye floating waters pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to burst in cooling showers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to deluge wintry hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With your relentless pour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou beauteous Rainbow bursting forth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With varied hues encircling earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sign to Noah made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I place amid the Clouds my Bow”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To show that I will nevermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deluge with angry flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mountains and Hills whose snow capped tops</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast horizon overlooks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pyramids strung and sure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor lightnings fierce nor earthquake shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can ever sway, for firm as rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye ever will endure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Ocean vast, oftimes thy breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is calm and still as if at rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like one in quiet sleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soon in anger thou may'st roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And madly toss from shore to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And human harvest reap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fountains and Rivulets so clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gush amid the valleys fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With soft and mellow ring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As coming forth from glade and wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your babblings whisper “God is good,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye make the vales to sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now when all nature swells the song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When beast and birds the strain prolong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall man from praise refrain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would the rocks and hills proclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All nature crying out for shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They who their Maker's image wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should shout and sing till rent the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rhapsodies sublime.</span>

			<p>
				<span>The earth was young, the world was fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And balmy breezes filled the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nature reposed in solitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When God pronounced it "very good."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The snow-capped mountain reared its head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deep, dark forests widely spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O'er pebbly shores the stream did play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On glad creation's natal day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But silence reigned, nor beast nor bird</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had from its mate a whisper heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E'en man, God's image from above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not, to Eve, tell of his love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where the four rivers met there strayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man and wife, no whit afraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the arch-fiend expelled from heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not yet found his way to Eden.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But lo! a light from 'mid the tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But hark! a rustling 'mongst the leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then a fair Angel from above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descending, sang his song of love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forth sprang the fierce beasts from their lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright feathered songsters fill the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All nature stirred to centre rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the celestial song began.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Lion, monarch of the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First tried to imitate the strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shaking high his mane he roared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till beast and bird around him cohered.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The little Linnet tuned her lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lark, in turn, did welcome day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cooing soft, the timid Dove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did to his mate tell of his love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Eve, the synonym of grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew nearer to the solemn place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard the words to music set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In tones so sweet, she ne'er forgot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The anthems from the earth so rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Higher and higher filled the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Seraphs caught the inspiring strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And morning stars together sang.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then laggard Adam sauntered near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What Eve had heard he too must hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ah! for aye will woman's voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make man to sigh or him rejoice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Only the fishes in the deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not arouse them from their sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So they alas! did never hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Angel's visit to this sphere.</span>

				<span>For have they ever said one word</span>

			<p>
				<span>'Twas a lovely autumn morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the leaves were turning red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sturdy oaks and graceful pines</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their branches over-spread;</span>

				<span>For the rising sun had shown</span>

			<p>
v#In a far off hamlet near the sea
v#Where billows oft, in days of storm, and
v#Nights of darkness rush reckless to the shore;
v#Where tall, white cliffs like watchmen keep
v#A life-long vigil; Oft when the morning
v#Sunbeams gild their lofty peaks they seem
v#Like massive crystal vases adorned with
v#Rays of gold.
</p>
<p>
v#####Hard-by those snowy cliffs,
v#Shielded safe from cutting winds and icy
v#Blasts, stood an humble, unpretending cot,
v#Its low, thatched roof of matted moss
v#Glimmered, when the morning sun brightened
v#Up the valley, and cast its rays aslant tli rough
v#The tiny windows ignorant of glass.    Its well-
v#Scrubbed floor shone like polished wood;
v#And all around an air of quiet, peace and
v#Love, prevailed.
</p>
<p>
v#####Within that cosy nest, there
v#Dwelt three loving hearts, Nay, four, for on the
v#Very morn when Christmas bells were
v#Hinging o'er the land, When children of the rich
v#And children of the poor alike, were talking
v#Of the Christ-child, and his day, Unto them a
v#Child was given, And this lovely babe, blest Christmas
v#Gift, — was richly prized. E'en now she knew her
v#Father's voice, and leaped with joy at his return.
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<p>
v#But ah! the cry of war, broke o'er the land.    Cruel
v#War, that rends the households and the hearts;
v#That makes fond bosoms bleed; and waters all
v#The sod with tears, Salty, agonizing tears, which,
v#When they dry, leave furrows never healing.—
v#Sorrows, never ceasing.
</p>
<p>
v#####The mandate came.—
v#Marco must go. What! leave the dear ones all
v#Alone. The gray-haired sire sunning himself
v#Without the cottage door? The little wife in
v#Blooming womanhood? The cherub who in
v#Human form had come to bless his home?
v#Must he leave his treasures and away to
v#Distant shores, perchance, lay clown to die?
v#O! the thought was death itself.     Yet go he
v#Must. Each day he'd wander through the glade,
v#Where every blade and tuft of grass was dear,
v#So dear. All his life from babe to manhood,
v#Here was spent. Here he grew, and loved,
v#And wedded. Here the precious Mother in her
v#Green old age had yielded to the sharp scythe
v#Of the Reaper Death.     Could he leave her?
</p>
<p>
v#####The day of
v#Parting came. The sun was high when Marco
v#Rose. The cheery little table decked with snowy
v#Cloth was laid. Out from their frugal hoard
v#Came every dainty Uranne could find.
v#Naught was too good for him. The dear, the
v#Faithful ! He who had done all in human power
v#To make her life joyous.    Truly, she said, as tears
v#Lingered in her eyes, "My lines in pleasant places
v#Have been cast.”
</p>
<p>
v#####Well long they tarried o'er that
v#Meal. It seemed as though 'twould never end,
v#And yet they were not eating. At last the babe
v#Stretched forth its chubby hands and with
v#Infantile speech, broke up the silent meal.
</p>
<p>
v#####Marco arose,—
v#Father, adieu. Take care of these as best thou
v#Can'st. I know the load is much too great for
v#Thee. Whose silvery hairs are whitening o'er with age.
v#Do all thou can'st and leave the rest to "Him
v#Who notes when e'en the sparrows fall."
</p>
<p>
v#And now, Uranne! truest and best, I can
v#Not give thee any more my heart, for thou had'st
v#It all long ago. Thy love to me has been like
v#Silver lining 'mid the clouds of life.
v#Has opened up my heart to kindlier feelings
v#For all who on this earth have naught to cheer.
v#To solace them in hours like these.
</p>
<p>
v#####But time doth
v#Fly.    Whether the moments teem with joy or
v#Flit in sorrow.    So Marco said, e're yet I go,
v#Take this bunch of half -blown buds and place
v#Upon your breast, near your heart, and wear
v#Them till I come.    Let naught divide 'twixt
v#Thee and them.    'Mid summer's glow or winter's
v#Cold, loved one, wear them next thy heart.
v#Their very name, Forget-Me-Not, will 'mind
v#Thee of thy lover-husband.
</p>
	<hr/>
	<p>
v#####Days, weeks,
v#Months passed by.    No tidings yet had
v#Come to them, in that lone village by the sea,
v#Ofttimes the sire would hand-in-hand take
v#Baby for a walk "by the sad, sea waves"—
v#Then would the little one pick up shells
v#And moss, and lisp so sweetly with
v#Infantile grace, that the aged form would
v#Straighten up, as if once more the fires of youth
v#Burned brightly in his veins; and his old
v#Bereaved heart would leap for joy.
</p>
<p>
v#####Alas! when early
v#Spring had come, and the little snowdrops
v#Gleamed in the valley, little Bright-eyes
v#Faded and was laid beneath them.
v#O! then the sun went down in blackness grim.
v#And the whole world seemed devoid of life;
v#Not worth living, the old man cried. And
v#Then he, too, alas! was laid beside the babe.
</p>
<p>
v#####All through the long-,
v#Long summer lonely Uranne dwelt. Her heart
v#Low down beneath the Daisies. Uranne, the
v#Pride of him who now, alas! was no more. Perchance
v#He too was sleeping in that far-off land,
v#Without a kindly hand to smooth his aching
v#Brow, or wipe from his cheeks the damp
v#Death dews.
</p>
<p>
v#####One morning when the dew
v#Had not yet left the sodden grass,
v#She left the cot to look for her beloved.
v#She sat her down 'mid the dingy rocks, which
v#Girt the shore. The little ripples kissed her feet
v#Caressingly. Long she looked for a white sail,
v#To greet her tired eyes.
</p>
<p>
v#####Marco, dost hear Uranne's
v#Call? Wilt thon no more return?    My heart is
v#Breaking with its load. No longer can I wait,—
v#But list! I'll whhisper in thine ear,—
v###The blue “Forget-Me Nots,
v###The sweet Forget Me Nots” which thou
v#Did'st place upon my breast.    Thou wilt see them
v#When thou com'st.    None shall them remove.
v#Sweetheart, I keep them till you come.
</p>
<p>
v#####There they found her cold
v#And stark.    With hand pressed close to heart
v#Where lay her flowers.    The sounding sea seemed
v#To forget to hurl its billows 'gainst the beach
v#Now white and shining.    E'en the little ripples
v#Seemed to say, Uranne!     And the great
v#Mountain rocks would echo back, Uranne!
</p>
<p>
v#####Years went by. The war, the
v#Cruel war was at an end. And Peace with
v#Flowing mantle had overspread the land;—
v#With anxious heart, but willing feet, the
v#Soldier started for his dear old cabin nestled
v#So snugly in the valley.     Would he And them all?
v#The dear old sire with his silvered hair—Perchance
v#He had lain him down to sleep, beside the wife
v#Who had left him in his prime.
</p>
<p>
v#####But she, the dear
v#Uranne, she was there, no doubt of that.    A stronger,
v#Healthier lass ne'er spun the dance.
v#Then the baby, our baby.    How she must have
v#Grown. "Wonder if she remembers me, her own dear
v#Sire?    Who oft would soothe and rock to sleep.
v#O yes; Uranne has taught her to love and lisp
v#My name.
</p>
<p>
v#####When the proud vessel dropped her
v#Anchor in the Bay, no prouder man, nor
v#Hopeful, than was Marco.    Lightly he sprang
v#Ashore. He looked to right, to left, no sign of
v#His loved ones cheered his gaze.
v#Uranne, he cried, What! no welcome for Marco?
v#Xo outstretched arms to fold me in love's embrace?
v#He tottered to the cot all overgrown with
v#Weeds and trailing vines.    O! stars above write
v#On hardest stone, Desolate, forlorn—alone.
</p>
<p>
v#Unconsciously he moved along the lane
v#That led to the old church-yard.    The little
v#Tuneful bell that had pealed so joyously
v#On his marriage eve, was silent now.
v#He saw no one, nor questions asked.    But
v#Slowly crept to where three mounds were
v#Raised all side by side. He closely scanned
v#Them all, when lo! upon the longest grave,
v#A beauteous tuft of blue Forget-Me-Nots—
v#Aha! he cried, my bright, my blue Forget-Me-Nots!
</p>
<p>
v#My flowers which I placed upon her breast,
v#And bid her wear till we should meet again,
v#My faithful one.    The seeds matured on thy
v#Dear bosom, nourished by thine own mortality,
v#Pushed their way to the sunlight of earth,    To
v#Cheer and to 'mind of faithful love,
v#Love which lasts even after the gates of
v#Death are passed.    Then he wailed the whole
v#Daylong: Come, O! come! Uranne, come!
v#Like my flowers, leave your bed, too dark too
v#Drear for thee.    Uranne, come to me!
v#Or I will come to thee!
</p>
<p>
v#There they found him, there they laid him,
v#With his flowers and Uranne.

	<p>
v#Magnolia! "Pale city of the dead,”
v#Adown thy gravelled walks I tread,
v#Thy marble pillars looming high,
v#Thy polished shafts around me lie.
v#With soft, mild rays, the winter sun
v#Thy tortuous pathways doth illume,
v#The weeping-willow droops its head,
v#To crown the "City of the Dead.”
</p>
	<p>
v#On every side death's tracks I see,
v#His footsteps grim encompass me,
v#The high-born here, the lowly there,
v#The proud man there, the humble here.
v#The rich has left his golden hoard,
v#No more he sits at festive board,
v#He could not bribe relentless death,
v#"With all his garnered stores of wealth.
</p>
	<p>
v#Here lies a maiden spotless fair,
v#Whose claim on life for many a year
v#Seemed sure. Bur the grim Reaper smiled,
v#And bending, claimed her for his child.
v#So lovingly they made her bed.
v#And tenderly these garlands spread,
v#Bright emblems of a stricken flower,
v#Now blooming in a sunnier bower.
</p>
	<p>
v#And here an infant's grave I see,
v#Ere sin could stain its purity,
v#It plumed its wings and upward soared,
v#To live forever with its God.
v#Though fair the earth, it would not stay,
v#Much fairer still the land away.
v#Restrain me not, for I would go
v#Where crystal fountains endless flow.
</p>
	<p>
v#With slow, sad steps I press me on
v#To a majestic tower of stone.
v#That tells me they who sleep around
v#Had for their country's weal laid down
v#Their lives. Ah! many a widowed heart
v#Hath bent and broke with sorrow's dart,
v#For him who now beneath the sod,
v#Yielded his spirit to his God.
</p>
	<p>
v#And many a youth with trappings gay,
v#'Mid martial music liveliest, lay,
v#No more in life returned to bless
v#Their loved ones with a fond caress,
v#But laid them down to their last sleep
v#In stranger land. Now angels keep
v#A loving vigil o'er each grave,
v#And bending branches o'er them wave.
</p>
	<p>
v#City of Shadows! fondly keep
v#The loved who in thy bosom sleep,
v#Shielded from every earthly care,
v#They rest secure and free from fear.
v#Let grasses green and flow'rets bright,
v#Always illume thy paths with light,
v#Till from the heavens loud and clear,
v#Resounds the invitation dear,
v#"Come up and meet me in the air,
v###My people."

v#I took up the burden of life anew
v##When she, the pure-hearted, died;
v#When the golden cord was rent in twain,
v##And she faded from my side.
v#When the eyes grew dim that were wont to glow
v##With the holy light of love,
v#And the spirit, freed from earthly care,
v##Sped to its rest above.
</p>
	<p>
v#Oh, the dreary days! Oh, the weary nights!
v##Oh, the anguish, who can tell?
v#When the light of my life went swiftly out,
v##And the shadow athwart me fell.
v#For the wound was deep, and the woe was great,
v##And its poignancy will blight
v#All the onward course of my future years,
v##Till my faith be turned to sight.
</p>
	<p>
v#I muse me now of the beautiful days,
v##The halcyon days of yore;
v#And wonder if e'er on life's stormy sea
v##Such days I shall ever see more.
v#The sky is as blue-tinted now as then,
v##And the sunlight just as bright;
v#But they gladden me not as in other days
v##Ere she faded from my sight.
</p>
	<p>
v#The clouds with their purple and amber hues—
v##Their gossamer robes of snow—
v#And the stars at the quiet twilight hour
v##In calm, clear beauty glow.
v#And music sweet as Æolian harp
v##Is echoing far and wide—
v#But, sure, naught gladdens my heart as before
v##She faded away from my side.
</p>
	<p>
v#O, Mother! in anguish I peer through the mists
v##Of a future, so dark without thee;
v#The desert of life hath truly been blessed
v##"With an oasis sacred to thee.
v#And oft to this green spot of beauty I turn,
v##My shrine of affection, my pride;
v#For, surely, naught gladdens my heart as before
v##Thou fadedst away from my side.

v#As I sit by the ruddy oak fire,
v##And feel the grateful glow,
v#Come mem'ries sweet of a rustic cot,
v##That stood near the pebbly shore.
</p>
	<p>
v#With its porch so bright and sunny,
v##Where the children loved to play,
v#With the sounding shells, from the sandy beach,
v##All through the summer's day.
</p>
	<p>
v#Where, where are the blessed little ones
v##Whose childish voices sweet,
v#Who made the sunny porch resound
v##With the patter of little feet?
</p>
	<p>
v#One where the South Seas wildly break,
v##And dash on the gleaming sand,
v#Has made Him a home 'mid strangers,
v##Far, far from his native land.

	<p>
v#Another, the sweetest and dearest,
v##Has long 'neath the daisies been laid,
v#O! dark as a pall was the hour
v##When they whispered my darling was dead.

	<p>
v#Come back to me, O ye, my children:
v##Come back to the home as of yore;
v#As my longing eye peers through the vista of years,
v##Comes the heart-throbbing more and more.
v#I sit by the casement and listen
v##To the fall of the soft, sobbing rain,
v#E'en the winds gently sigh as if loth to reply—
v##In vain, fond mother, in vain.
</p>
	<p>
v#Are ye gone for aye? Shall I no more hear
v##The ring and the din of glee?
v#Have my nestlings flown and left me alone?
v##Shall their faces, I no more see?
v#I sit, and I wait while the days go by,
v##And the months merge slow into years;
v#Till the twilight deep and the mystic sleep,
v##And the hopes give place to fears.
</p>
	<p>
v#When the Christmas chimes with its holy rhymes
v##Ring out o'er the frosty plain,
v#Then I sit, and sigh for the "Sweet bye and bye"—
v##But the answer comes, "Mother in vain."
v#Each one of us, children, have gone forth
v##To fight out life's battles alone;
v#And the future must prove if your labor of love.
v##Has, like bread on the waters, been thrown.
</p>
	<p>
v#So the twilight comes — and the fire burns low—
v##And the day is ebbing fast—
v#Soon the merry chimes and the hallowed rhymes
v##Will be numbered with the Past.
v#But with hopeful eyes I'll scan the skies,
v##Perchance, ere next Christmas-tide,
v#Will my children come to their own dear home,
v##And their place at mother's side.

v#Oh! surely 'tis a theme sublime

v#My song shall be of him, whose hand

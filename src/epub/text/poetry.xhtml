				<span>O Earth, adore creative power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made and gave to man as dower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This world of beauty rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hills and vales of verdant green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rills and brooks of crystal sheen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lovely beyond compare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Sun, bright ruler of the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first thy power thou did'st display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Earth must have shrank in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When like a meteor burst thy light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning to day the long, long night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With radiance wondrous fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Moon, pale sister of the Sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he his daily work has done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou comest forth a queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A queen in silvery robe adorned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tiara of jewels formed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of starry orbs unseen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye twinkling stars of milder light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though now ye gleam like sapphires bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across yon azure dome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The day will dawn, that last dread day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from yon heaven you'll fall away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And man to Judgment come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thunder and Lightnings burst and gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frightful and fierce to us they seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rending the darkened sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like giants tread the thunder's peal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vivid lightnings swiftly steal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And men in terror fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O filmy clouds, of purest white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With robes of gossamer cased in white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye floating waters pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to burst in cooling showers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes to deluge wintry hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With your relentless pour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou beauteous Rainbow bursting forth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With varied hues encircling earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sign to Noah made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I place amid the Clouds my Bow”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To show that I will nevermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deluge with angry flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mountains and Hills whose snow capped tops</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast horizon overlooks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pyramids strung and sure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor lightnings fierce nor earthquake shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can ever sway, for firm as rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye ever will endure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou Ocean vast, oftimes thy breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is calm and still as if at rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like one in quiet sleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soon in anger thou may'st roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And madly toss from shore to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And human harvest reap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fountains and Rivulets so clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gush amid the valleys fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With soft and mellow ring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As coming forth from glade and wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your babblings whisper “God is good,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye make the vales to sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now when all nature swells the song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When beast and birds the strain prolong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall man from praise refrain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would the rocks and hills proclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All nature crying out for shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They who their Maker's image wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should shout and sing till rent the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rhapsodies sublime.</span>

				<span>Night and a starless sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ship on wild billows tost,</span>

				<span>With tattered sails and opening seams.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deck bestrewn with falling beams.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid carnival of woe.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Trailing her hymn of death,</span>

				<span>While the crew send forth one anguished cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sinking to lowest depth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some ships go out to sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That never more return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Souls that from heaven in infancy come,</span>

				<span>Tarnished and ruined by sin may become,</span>

				<span>Like the Dove to the Ark they never return,</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Saxon Legend of Language</h2>
			<p>
v#The earth was young, the world was fair,
v#And balmy breezes filled the air,
v#Nature reposed in solitude,
v#When God pronounced it "very good."
</p>
<p>
v#The snow-capped mountain reared its head,
v#The deep, dark forests widely spread,
v#O'er pebbly shores the stream did play
v#On glad creation's natal day.
</p>
<p>
v#But silence reigned, nor beast nor bird
v#Had from its mate a whisper heard,
v#E'en man, God's image from above,
v#Could not, to Eve, tell of his love.
</p>
<p>
v#Where the four rivers met there strayed
v#The man and wife, no whit afraid,
v#For the arch-fiend expelled from heaven
v#Had not yet found his way to Eden.
</p>
<p>
v#But lo! a light from 'mid the tree,
v#But hark! a rustling 'mongst the leaves,
v#Then a fair Angel from above,
v#Descending, sang his song of love.
</p>
<p>
v#Forth sprang the fierce beasts from their lair,
v#Bright feathered songsters fill the air,
v#All nature stirred to centre rang
v#When the celestial song began.
</p>
<p>
v#The Lion, monarch of the plain,
v#First tried to imitate the strain,
v#And shaking high his mane he roared,
v#Till beast and bird around him cohered.
</p>
<p>
v#The little Linnet tuned her lay,
v#The Lark, in turn, did welcome day,
v#And cooing soft, the timid Dove
v#Did to his mate tell of his love.
</p>
<p>
v#Then Eve, the synonym of grace,
v#Drew nearer to the solemn place,
v#And heard the words to music set
v#In tones so sweet, she ne'er forgot.
</p>
<p>
v#The anthems from the earth so rare,
v#Higher and higher filled the air,
v#Till Seraphs caught the inspiring strain,
v#And morning stars together sang.
</p>
<p>
v#Then laggard Adam sauntered near,
v#What Eve had heard he too must hear,
v#But ah! for aye will woman's voice
v#Make man to sigh or him rejoice.
</p>
<p>
v#Only the fishes in the deep
v#Did not arouse them from their sleep,
v#So they alas! did never hear
v#Of the Angel's visit to this sphere.
v#For have they ever said one word
v#To mate or man, or beast or bird.

			<p>
v#On a starry, wintry night,
v##Frosty and cold was the air,
v#And the lowly yale where Bethlehem stood,
v##Looked bleak, and barren and bare.
</p>
<p>
v#Her streets deserted and dim,
v##Lit only by myriads of stars,
v#That with shimm'ring light illumined the night,—
v##Among them was fiery Mars.
</p>
<p>
v#Adown 'mid the yalley so drear
v##Knelt men, in wonder and fear,
v#For lo! in the distance a bright star had risen
v##Wondrously brilliant and clear.
</p>
<p>
v#Then an Angel's yoice they heard
v##In heayenly tones it said,
v#To yon I bring “glad tidings of joy,"
v##Fear not nor be dismayed."
</p>
<p>
v#Go follow that star, 'twill lead
v##To the Christ-child's lowly bed,
v#Though Israel's King, He sleeps in an "inn"
v##Where the cattle oft are fed.
</p>
<p>
v#Then oyer the humble place
v##Where the Royal Babe was laid,
v#Did the “Star of the East,” blest Bethlehem’s star,
v##Irradiate no more to fade.
</p>
<p>
v#O! brightest and best they cried,
v##Our long promised Israel's King,
v#Shine out from afar, thou bright morning star,
v##To thee our offerings we bring.
</p>
<p>
v#Bethlehem! blest city of old
v##Like pilgrims to Mecca we come,
v#To thy hallowed site, on each Christmas night,
v##The Christ-child's humble home.
